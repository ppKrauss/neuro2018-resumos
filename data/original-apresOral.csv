75253,EFFECTS OF ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS ON SPREADING DEPRESSION IN THE CHICK RETINA: IMPLICATIONS FOR MIGRAINE PROPHYLAXIS,"In the present study we analize the effects of GABAergic antiepileptic drugs , also used in migrain prophylaxis, on the spreading depression ( SD ) in isolated retina of pintos Gallus. They were studied five drugs with proved effect on the GABAergic transmission modulation : Topiramato, Divalproato, Gabapentina, Lamotrigina and Levetiracetam. We use chicken retinas, kept 30-31°C in superfusion chamber, where a Ringer‘s reference solution, flow at 1.0 - 1.8 ml/min.; The reaction was evoked by mechanical and chemical stimulus, every 15 minutes. They were checked, in this model, the speed (mm/min.), the amplitude (mV), the deflagration threshold (after chemical stimulus with KCl-) and the absolute refractory period (in seconds)of the SD , with and without the drugs use in study. In a second time, they were analized, in models in vivo, the speed parameters and amplitude, also with and without the drugs in study. Complementary, the GABA-T enzyme activity , was determined, with and without the drugs in study. We verify that all the drugs, especially Topiramato, reduce in a manner of, and of reversible form, the speed and amplitude, so much in vitro as in vivo. All the drugs increase, of reversible form, the deflagration threshold for the SD, after chemical stimulus with KCl-, in specific concentrations. It was verified, as well, that all the drugs increase, of reversible form, the absolute refractory period. Topiramato was considered the most effective drug in the context of the proposed parameters . Levetiracetam, despite your mechanism of innovative action, was considered the less effective drug. The enzyme GABA-T presents its activity decreased , in the presence of Topiramato, Divalproato and Gabapentina. These results are important for migrain correct knowledge and treatment.",Cefaleia,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,JOÃO BAPTISTA MASCARENHAS DE MORAES NETO,"JOÃO BAPTISTA MASCARENHAS DE MORAES NETO / Neto, J.

74727,POSTUROGRAPHY AND MINIBESTEST IN PATIENTS WITH VESTIBULAR DISORDERS AND CEREBELLAR ATAXIA,"Posturography may contribute to evaluation of patients with balance symptoms, but there is some controversy if posturography may diagnose different balance disorders. Further, miniBESTest is a relatively new clinical scale used to evaluate balance and identify risk of fall, but there are only few studies that analyse the results of miniBESTest in vestibular patients. Objective To evaluate balance in patients with vestibular disorders and cerebellar ataxia, using dynamic posturography and miniBESTest Methods Patients with unilateral vestibular lesions (UVL) in subacute phase, bilateral vestibulopathy (BV), central vestibular syndromes (CVS) and cerebellar ataxia (CA) were included. All patients were evaluated using a dynamic posturography (ProBalance Master®, NeuroCom/USA), in four different conditions: condition 1 - eyes open and condition 2 - eyes closed both with fixed support surface, condition 3- eyes open and condition 4 - eyes closed both with unfixed support surface. An equilibrium score is computed detecting the range of the sway angle (relative to earth vertical) in degrees, for each condition and at the end (composite). A score of 100 represents no body sway and 0 represents maximum sway or fall. The MiniBESTest is a 14-item test (total score: 28) and includes anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, sensory orientation and stability in gait. Results Forty-seven patients underwent 105 balance evaluations. All patients had abnormal values in dynamic posturography and miniBESTest, and there was a positive correlation between both methods (r=0,56, p<0,0001, Spearman test). Two different patterns were identified in posturography: patients with UVL and BV had normal score in conditions 1 and 2 and abnormal values in conditions 3 and 4, and patients with CVS and CA had abnormal values in all conditions. Further, patients with UVL and BV had different scores in conditions 4 (worse in BV group), and patients with CVS and CA had different scores in conditions 1, 2 and 3 (worse in CA group). Discussion Both, posturography and miniBESTest can be used to evaluate patients with vestibular disorders and cerebellar ataxia. Posturography may show different patterns in different vestibular disorders, and condition 4 may different patients with less severe balance disorders as UVL and BV, and condition 1, 2 and 3 may different patients with more severe balance disorders such as CVS and CA.",Distúrbio Vestibulares e do Equilíbrio,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,CRISTIANA BORGES PEREIRA,"Saulo Nardy Nader / Nader, Saulo N / HOSPITAL DAS CLINCIAS FMUSP; Victor Gonçalves Lopes / Lopes VL / HOSPITAL DAS CLINCIAS FMUSP; Emanuelle Roberta da Silva Aquino / Aquino ERS / HOSPITAL DAS CLINCIAS FMUSP; Cristiana Borges Pereira / Pereira CB / HOSPITAL DAS CLINCIAS FMUSP;"
73905,STATIC AND DYNAMIC SUBJECTIVE VERTICAL VISUAL IN STROKE PATIENTS: A NEW METHOD USING VIRTUAL REALITY,"Background: The vertical perception can be assessed by three different modalities: the subjective visual vertical (SVV), the subjective postural vertical and haptic vertical. The SVV is the most studied and frequently described as altered in stroke patients. However, the literature describes different methods to assess SVV and differences among paradigms are little studied, as well as, new paradigms that really reflect real life situations. Therefore, the main objective of this study was compare static and dynamic SVV in a sample of stroke patients and to propose a new dynamic paradigm using virtual reality that simulates a walk and drive a car. Methods: We included patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke confirmed by neuroimage. The protocol assessment was composed by demographic, clinical data, assessment of sensorimotor and vestibular function and SVV evaluation. The SVV was assessed in roll plane, using a new method called 3D Immersive Subjective Visual Vertical (3DISVV). In 3DISVV, a luminous bar of 7 centimeters was projected on a virtual reality oculus in a dark environment (static SVV  SVV2D), and after, associated with a linear optokinetic stimuli (dynamic SVV) with two different velocities, 5km/h (DinSVV5) and 40km/h (DinSVV40). The final result of SVV is the mean of 10 trials and a positive sign indicated an ipsilesional tilt and a negative sign a contralesional tilt. Results: We evaluated 28 patients, mean age of 56.4±12.7 years, median NIHSS 0(0-2), median Rankin score 1(1-2). The mean of SVV2D was -0.80°±4.25°, DinSVV5 was -0.45°±4.08° and DinSVV40 was -1.55°±3.82°. Ten patients had an altered SVV2D (>2.5°), of which, all had hemispheric strokes, 5 had abnormal ipsilesional tilt, less severe, 5.9°±2.9°, comparing with the 5 patients with abnormal contralesional tilt, -7.02°±1.65°. There was no significant difference between static and dynamic SVV (p=0.60). Conclusion: The results of static and dynamic SVV are similar to those described in previous studies with stroke patients. We found 35% of our sample with altered SVV. However, we did not find differences among static and dynamic paradigms. Stroke patients had a visual dependency and consequently, biased judgment of vertical when the visual scene had interferences. Because of that, dynamic paradigms could be a more sensitive method to be used as a screening tool. However, a study with a larger number of participants is needed to better understand the differences among paradigms.",Distúrbio Vestibulares e do Equilíbrio,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,Leticia Januzi de Almeida Rocha,"Jussara A.

74289,IMPACT OF INFECTIONS AND METABOLIC DISORDERS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF DELIRIUM AFTER STROKE IN PATIENTS ADMITTED TO A SPECIALIZED UNIT,"INTRODUCTION: Delirium is an acute state of altered attention and level of consciousness, secondary to factors such as infections, metabolic disorders and stroke. Between 28 and 40% of patients suffering from stroke develop acute confusional states. In this specific population, advanced age, nosocomial infections, hemorrhagic stroke and dementia are related to a higher frequency of delirium at admission. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the presence of main factors associated with ocurrence of delirium in hospitalized patients due to stroke. METHODS: Its a prospective cohort with patients hospitalized in a stroke unit with a 30 day after ictus follow-up. The study was performed between november 2017 and june 2018. The research participants must had 18 years or more and had suffered from stroke. Those who were admitted to the unit after 72 hours from the ictus, with pontuation less than -3 on RASS scale, severe aphasia or psychiatric disorders that made it impossible to apply the Confusion Evaluation Scale (CAM) were excluded. The data were analyzed using SPSS v21. RESULTS: 128 patients were admitted. The mean age was 62.5 (±13.5), majority of women (53.1%), brown (39.1%) and 84.2% were ischemic strokes. Among the 128, 41 (32.8%) developed delirium, of which 27 (65.9%) developed infections during hospitalization, with a higher ocurrence of respiratory tract infections (RTI) (34.1%) followed by urinary tract infections (UTI) (12.2%); 23 patients had metabolic disorders (56.1%), with a higher ocurrence of sodium imbalance (29.2%), especially hypernatremia, followed my calcium imbalance (26.8%), especially hypercalcemia, and acute kidney injury (19.5%). A positive association was found between the development of delirium and infection in hospital setting (p<0.001), metabolic disorders (p=0.003), previous use of benzodiazepine (p=0.022) and smoking abstention (p=0.045). As factors that may evolve into confusional states, 24.2% of the patients were chronic alcoholics, 42.7% were smokers, that 28.8% of which were in abstention from tobacco use with an average time of 193 ± 143 months since quitting, and 4% used benzodiazepines. CONCLUSION: In this study, a higher prevalence of RTI was observed in patients with delirium, and it was observed that the development of this clinical situation was associated with the occurrence of infection and metabolic disorders, previous use of benzodiazepines and smoking abstention.","Doença Cerebrovascular, Neurologia Intervencionista e Terapia Intensiva em Neurologia",Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,LETÍCIA MASCARENHAS DE SOUZA,"Letícia Mascarenhas de Souza / SOUZA, L.M. / FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA UFBA; Thiago Brito Pinheiro / Pinheiro, TB / UFBA; Pedro Augusto Assis Lopes / Lopes, PA / UFBA; Gabriel Nascimento Silva / Silva, GN / UFBA; Lays Oliveira Carneiro / Carneiro, LO / UFBA; Ivã Taiuan Fialho Silva / Silva, IT / UFBA; Beatriz Kelly Oliveira Silva / Silva, BK / UFBA; Caroline Ciriaco Cerqueira Cunha / Cunha, CC / HGRS; João Pedro Bastos de Santana / Santana, JP / UFBA; Pedro Antonio Pereira de Jesus / Jesus, PA / HGRS;"
74104,IS A MINOR ISCHEMIC STROKE REALLY MILD? A CASE-CONTROL STUDY,"Background: Patients with minor ischemic stroke (MIS) are assumed to achieve full recovery with little or no intervention. However, such patients may experience persistent disability and deficits that may be completely under diagnosed. Objective: Assess the proportion of patients who suffered a minor ischemic stroke with impaired HRQOL, HADS, and FSS comparing to healthy subjects. Identify possible predictors of impaired clinical outcomes using logistic regression. Methods: We recruited 356 consecutive patients with MIS who had initial NIHSS score < 6, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 or 1 at baseline and 3-month follow-up. The neurologist who previously classified the stroke as mild was blind to this study. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and fatigue severity scale (FSS) were prospectively recorded. The same scales were applied to 100 healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression and multivariate analysis. Results: Among the 356 patients who met study criteria, 48.6 % were male and the mean age was 61.2 years. Any HRQOL impairment was noted in 234 patients (65.7%). Depression and fatigue was present in 149 (41.9%) and 199 (55.9%), respectively. Fatigue, depression and anxiety were independently associated with a worse HRQOL (p<0.01). Prevalence of post-stroke anxiety, depression and fatigue were significantly higher compared with the control group (p<0.05). In multivariate analysis, age, initial NIHSS, socio-demographic characteristics and female gender were independent predictors of mood disorders and poor HRQOL (p<0.05). Conclusions: HRQOL, FSS and HADS impairment are common in MIS. Quality of life, mood disorders and fatigue may play an important role in the evaluation of patients with minor ischemic stroke. This study suggests that it is imperative that clinicians investigate these parameters in MIS population.","Doença Cerebrovascular, Neurologia Intervencionista e Terapia Intensiva em Neurologia",Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,BRUNO KUSZNIR VITTURI,"Bruno Kusznir Vitturi / Vitturi, B.

72592,LARGE-SCALE BRAIN NETWORKS CONNECTIVITY AND NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IMPAIRMENT IN STROKE-FREE PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION,"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a risk factor for dementia independently of the presence of stroke. Cerebral damage such as grey matter atrophy may be associated with dementia in AF. No previous study has evaluated large-scale brain networks and cognitive performance in stroke-free patients with AF. Objective: To evaluate large-scale brain networks and cognitive performance in stroke-free patients with AF. Design: Twelve subjects with AF and no evidence of stroke or dementia acquired structural and functional 3-Tesla MRI. Subjects were submitted to clinical, physical and laboratorial examination and a wide battery of neuropsychological evaluation accessing executive function, memory, constructional praxia, language, speed of processing and visuoconstructive skills. Patients were compared to 12 controls with no history of dementia or stroke and matched for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors (CHA2DS2-VASc score). Twelve brain networks (anterior and posterior salience, language, right and left executive-control (EC), auditory, visual, visuospatial, basal ganglia, ventral and dorsal default mode (DMN) and sensorimotor), were evaluated in first and second level analysis to access inter (between different networks) and intra (within a specific network) connectivity. Statistical analysis was performed with UF2C and SPM12 softwares (ANCOVA, p<0.001, covariated for age, sex, heart failure and hypertension). T-test was used to evaluate cognitive performance. Results: We found no statistical difference between AF and controls regarding sex, age or CHA2DS2VASc-score. AF had higher frequency of heart failure (p=0.037). There was significant difference in executive function and attention performance in AF group (Rey complex figure copy, p=0.006; Rey complex figure evocation p=0.04; trail-making test B, p=0.037). Compared with controls, we found decreased intra-network connectivity in language network. Inter-network connectivity was decreased between posterior salience versus right EC and auditory networks and it was increased between DMN versus sensoriomotor, visuospatial and posterior and anterior salience networks. We found inversion of the pattern of connectivity in posterior DMN, visual, language, auditory, sensoriomotor and right and left EC networks. Conclusions: Patients with AF without stroke or dementia have diffuse intra and inter-brain networks abnormal connectivity as well as reduced cognitive performance in executive and attention functions.","Doença Cerebrovascular, Neurologia Intervencionista e Terapia Intensiva em Neurologia",Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,DANILO DOS SANTOS SILVA,Danilo dos Santos Silva / Silva DS / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Bruna Gonçalves Caseli / Caseli BG / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Wagner Mauad Avelar / Avelar WM / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Brunno Machado de Campos / Campos BM / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Ana Paula Beppler Lazaro Lino / Lino APBL / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Marcio Luiz Figueredo Balthazar / Balthazar MLF / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Marcio Jansen de Oliveira Figueiredo / Figueiredo MJO / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Luiz Fernando Longuim Pegoraro / Pegoraro LFL / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Fernando Cendes / Cendes F / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP; Ana Carolina Coan / Coan AC / Universidade Estadual de Campinas-UNICAMP;
74737,PREDICTORS OF LOW COMPLEXITY EMERGENCY CARE UNITS (UPA 24H) UTILIZATION BY PATIENTS WITH STROKE SYMPTOMS.,"INTRODUCTION: In acute stroke, early symptoms identification and rapid transport to a stroke center can define treatment and prognosis. In the last decade, hundreds of low complexity Emergency Care Units (UPA 24h) were launched in Brazil. Distributed throughout the city, the UPA 24h, are designed to provide care for patients with acute diseases. In Fortaleza, Ceará, although there is a well-organized comprehensive stroke center, UPA 24h are the second institutions most sought by patients with stroke symptoms what is associated with up to 50% decrease in ischemic stroke thrombolysis rate. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate predictors of seeking care for acute stroke in UPA 24h besides home proximity. METHODS: Data were prospectively collected from consecutive patients admitted to 31 hospitals in Fortaleza with acute stroke from February 3 to December 31, 2014. We traced all pathways since symptom onset to hospital arrival. RESULTS: A total of 3,052 patients (mean age, 66.1 ±15.6 years; 51% men) were evaluated. Ischemic stroke was the most frequent stroke subtype (70%) followed by intraparenchymal hemorrhage (18%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (9%), and undetermined stroke (3%). Of the 2,362 patients from Fortaleza, 33% went straight to Hospital Geral de Fortaleza, our stroke center, 27% went to the UPA 24h, 18% went to private hospitals and 22% went to other institutions. Patients who typically sought UPA 24h were younger (< 50 y) (OR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.83; P = 0,04); had low educational levels (0R 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06 - 2.23; P=0,03); did not call EMS (OR 1.76; 95% CI, 1.32 - 2.38; P <0,001); had headache at onset (OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.06 - 1.67; P = 0,01), had no speech deficits (OR 1.50; 95% CI, 1.16 - 1.94; P = 0,002) and were transported by their own means (OR 2.35; 95% CI, 1.59 - 3.56; P < 0,001). When adjusted for the HDI and stroke type, being a female (OR 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03 - 1.76; P = 0,03), not calling EMS (OR 2.27; 95% CI, 1.58 - 3.30; P < 0,001), having headache at onset (OR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02 - 1.85; P = 0,04) and being transported by their own means (OR 3.06; 95% CI, 1.90 - 5.08; P < 0,001) were independent predictors of UPA 24h utilization. CONCLUSION: Our original data suggest that age, educational level, sex, headache at onset, no speech deficits and prehospital transportation are predictors of UPA 24h utilization in the acute stroke care setting. This information can guide effective public health policies to improve acute stroke care.","Doença Cerebrovascular, Neurologia Intervencionista e Terapia Intensiva em Neurologia",Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,JOAO JOSE FREITAS DE CARVALHO,"JOAO JOSE FREITAS DE CARVALHO / de Carvalho, J.J.F. / HOSPITAL GERAL DE FORTALEZA; JOÃO JOSÉ FREITAS DE CARVALHO / de Carvalho, J.J.F / Hospital Geral de Fortaleza; GISELE SAMPAIO SILVA / Silva, G.S. / Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein; PEDRO BRAGA NETO / Braga Neto, P. / Hospital Geral de Fortaleza; FABRICIO OLIVEIRA LIMA / Lima, F.O. / Hospital Geral de Fortaleza; RENATA CAROLINA ACRI NUNES MIRANDA / Miranda, R.C.A.N. / Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein; BENTO FORTUNATO CARDOSO DOS SANTOS / Santos, B.F.C. / Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein; MARINA ROCHA ROLIM / Rolim, M.R. / Universidade Estadual do Ceará; BRUNO LIMAVERDE VILAR LOBO / Lobo, B.L.V. / Universidade Estadual do Ceará; GABRIEL PINHEIRO MARTINS DE ALMEIDA E SOUZA / Souza, G.P.M.A. / Universidade Estadual do Ceará;"
73594,READMISSION AFTER STROKE/TIA IN A JOINT COMMISSION STROKE CERTIFIED CENTER,"Introduction: Stroke is a high contributor to health system costs in Brazil1. Stroke survivors are in risk of new stroke or new hospital admission2. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an important risk factor for stroke, but is also risk factor for cardiac death3. Thus, survivors after Stroke and TIA could be readmitted in hospital. Understand causes of hospital readmission after TIA/Stroke may guide health system to adopt preventive actions avoiding new hospitalization. Purpose: verify readmission causes in Stroke/TIA patients checking preventable causes. Methods: We performed medical records random search in alive discharged Stroke/TIA patients between 2014 and 2016, in a Joint Commission Stroke certified center. We used TOAST classification to define stroke/TIA etiology4; collected clinical aspects of stroke population and reasons and dates for all new readmissions. Readmissions for elective carotid intervention or cranioplasty were not computed. Patients in palliative care were excluded. Preventable readmissions were defined according to the AHRQ Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs)5. Results: We collected 131 patients´ data, 62 (47%) were women. We had 39 (30%) patients readmitted, in a total of 83 readmissions. Main Stroke etiology in readmitted patients was: 30 ischemic stroke, 7 TIA, 2 hemorrhagic stroke. The average between first admission and readmission was 6,1 months (SD 5,24). Ischemic stroke was cause of rehospitalization in 9 (7%) patients. Cardioembolism was first stroke reason in 6 patients that were readmitted, large vessel disease in one, and indeterminate cause in one. Anticoagulation adjustment was major action after ischemic stroke recurrence. One patient died after new stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for two rehospitalizations. Ten patients (7,6%) went in hospital because of preventable causes, according to PQIs. Two died because infective complications. Other important causes of readmissions were: TIA (9), seizures (5), warfarin intoxication (3), syncope (3), cranioplasty complications (2), other vascular causes (3). Conclusions: Readmission after stroke is very common and could happen in few months after hospital discharge. We found that the most important causes of recurrence of ischemic stroke are cardiac disease. Preventable readmissions after strokes according to PQI could lead to death. More studies are need to enlarge patients samples, and confirm consistence of those results.","Doença Cerebrovascular, Neurologia Intervencionista e Terapia Intensiva em Neurologia",Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,TARSILA ANTUNES BRONER ROCHA,"LUCIANO MAGALHÃES MELO / MELO, L.

75174,VOXEL BASED MORPHOMETRY IN POST-STROKE EPILEPSY REVEALS LIMBIC ATROPHY,"Introduction Seizures after stroke are very common, with an incidence around 10% and higher prevalence in hemorrhagic rather than in ischemic stroke (10-20% versus2-14%). In individuals older than 65 years, post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) seems to account for almost 50% of all new-onset seizures. Unfortunately, the etiopathology of PSE is still unclear despite the negative impact on quality of life, anxiety level and worse recovery. Objective We evaluated the grey matter atrophy (GMA) (unrelated to ischemic lesions) of twenty-six patients with PSE comparing to thirty controls (free of seizures) using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM). Method Patients (n=26; 61 ± 16 years) and controls (n=30; 60± 11 years) were balanced in terms of age (p= 0.5) and sex (p=0.4). All subjects underwent 3T MRI scans with 3D- T1 weighted images. VBM was performed with SPM12/CAT12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk) including steps of preprocessing (realignment, spatial normalization, tissue segmentation), running on Matlab2014. Statistical analyses with T-tests were performed with SPM12 to investigate patterns of GMA compared to controls. Significance was determined with p<0.05, adjusted with Bonferroni for multiple comparisons. Clinical information was analyzed with SPSS23. Results Late-onset PSE (seizures started after one week of stroke)occurred in 65% (n=17), with an average time of 1.4 years between stroke and the first seizure. Most of patients presented large vessels occlusions with cortico-subcortical lesions 84% (n=22) with theremaining 16% (n=4) showing lacunar lesions (small vessels disease). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, GMA was identified in the cerebellum (right: 4459 voxels, left: 2334 voxels), parahippocampal gyrus (1502 voxels), thalamus (1204 voxels) and hippocampus (955 voxels). All clusters presented p<0.05 Conclusion In this preliminary analysis, we identified limbic atrophy in subjects with PSE (combining lacunar and large vessels occlusions). While some studies report cortical lesions with a major risk of PSE, other show evidence that subcortical lesions may be involved in disruption of connecting fiber tracts which lead to degenerative alterations in the cortex.Further investigation with neuroimage resources may help to find biomarkers for epileptogenesisafter stroke, helping to predict patients likely to develop PSE.","Doença Cerebrovascular, Neurologia Intervencionista e Terapia Intensiva em Neurologia",Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,MARILISE KATSURAYAMA,"MARILISE KATSURAYAMA / Katsurayama, M. / UNICAMP; Marilise Katsurayama / Katsurayama, M / UNICAMP; Marina Koutsodontis M.

75160,WAKE-UP STROKE: EVALUATION OF STROKE SUBTYPES AND RISK FACTORS,"Introduction: Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability in many countries. Wake-up stroke (WUS), patients wake from sleep with a neurological vascular deficit, represents a large number of patients with stroke (near 25%). Since NINDS and ECASS, the knowledge of time of symptoms onset became an important information for stroke-neurologist. The use of rt-PA in acute ischemic strokes is a widespread clinical practice; and more recently the new techniques for acute treatment of stroke have been shown to be superior to the gold standard treatment that we have available. Objective: The aim of this study is describe the prevalence of WUS and what are the most common stroke subtypes and risk factors in patients with WUS in comparison with the other patients with stroke. Methods: We analyzed data from 1129 patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to São Lucas Hospital between April/2014 and April/2018. We analyzed the prevalence of the most important stroke risk factors in each stroke subtype, including age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking and dyslipidemia. Hypertension was defined as receipt of antihypertensive therapy or 2 measurements of systolic pressure >140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure >90 mm Hg. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a history of elevated serum glucose level (>100 mg/dL) on 2 independent readings before stroke or receipt of antidiabetes medication. Dyslipidemia was defined as a history of total cholesterol >200 mg/dL or triglycerides >200 mg/dL or receipt of lipid-lowering medication. Ischemic strokes were classified into the following categories according to TOAST classification. Results: Evaluating 1129 patients with mean age of 68.9 years old (51.3% male), we identified 337 (29.8%) patients with WUS. In this group the most common stroke subtype was large artery atherosclerosis (n:93  27.5%) following by cardiombolism (n:89  26.4%). The most common risk factors in this group were hypertension (83.1%), dylispidemia (50.9%), smoking (17.4%) and diabetes (14.7%). Conclusion: The knowlodge of stroke subtypes and risk factors in patients with WUS is important to define the best strategy of secondary stroke prevention. In our serie large artery atherosclerosis was the main cause of WUS.","Doença Cerebrovascular, Neurologia Intervencionista e Terapia Intensiva em Neurologia",Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,MÁRCIO SEVERO GARCIA,"MÁRCIO SEVERO GARCIA / Garcia, M.

74730,CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NIGROSTRIATAL SYSTEM IN A SAMPLE OF PATIENTS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS,"Introduction: The coexistence of ALS with clinical forms of parkinsonism although uncommon is found to a greater degree than would explain mere chance. This suggests that patients with ALS may have subclinical lesions of the nigrostriatal system. The pathological mechanisms of ALS and PD are still not fully understood and the coexistence of these two diseases suggests that they could share mechanisms in common. Here we present a sample of patients with clinically definitive or probable ALS who were evaluated with SPECT/TRODAT and compere with non-ALS controls. Objective: Evaluate alterations of the nigrostriatal system in patients with ALS by performing SPECT-TRODAT imaging Methods: Patients with clinically definite or probable ALS were selected from the of neuromuscular diseases service of the HISCMPA. A total of 8 patients entered the study. Patients were assessed with the ALSFRS scale to define severity and collected demographic data. All patients underwent NES evaluation with TRODAT. TRODAT results of patients with ALS were compared against those of patients from the movement disorders service with a diagnosis of PD less than 10 years of duration, and against patients from the same ambulatory with diagnosis of movement disorders not associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Results: 8 patients with ALS were evaluated, 4 clinically definite and 4 probable, ages between 29 - 75 years (SD 16.09, Mean 57.9). Non-neurodegenerative diseases patients with diagnoses of essential tremor 7, drug-induced parkinsonism 6, Psychogenic tremor 2 and Neurolues 1 were used as controls and 16 patients with PD less than 10 years of duration. A total of 75% of patients with ALS had TRODAT results below the levels considered normal (Values less than 1,1), 25% in the control group without neurodegenerative disease and 100% in the PD group. A statistically significant difference was found between patients with ALS and the control group without neurodegenerative disease in the TRODAT values <0.05. Conclusions: Our study fits with the neuropathological and functional evidence that demonstrates the existence of nigrostriatal dysfunction in patients with ALS. Further research to better understand the role of these changes in the pathophysiological process of ALS needs to be performed.",Doenças do Neurônio Motor  Esclerose Lateral Amiotrófica,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,DOUGLAS TOMIO NAKATA,"CLAUDIO ALEJANDRO JIMENEZ MONSALVE / MONSALVE, C.

75220,DISTINCT PATTERNS OF CEREBELLAR DAMAGE IN SPORADIC AND C9ORF72-RELATED ALS,"Background: Mounting evidence shows that ALS-related brain damage extends beyond pyramidal tracts and primary motor cortex. Some pathological reports found cerebellar abnormalities in ALS patients. Despite that, no analysis in vivo was performed yet to assess cerebellar involvement in sporadic and genetic forms of the disease. Objective: to assess whether the cerebellum is affected in ALS as well as to compare the pattern of cerebellar damage between sporadic and C9orf72-related ALS. Methods: We have studied 9 symptomatic C9orf72 ALS patients (5 men, mean age 50 yo), 9 symptomatic sporadic ALS patients (3 men, mean age 50.4 yo) and 9 gender and age-matched healthy controls (4 men, mean age 50.8 yo). All patients were regularly followed at UNICAMP or USP-Ribeirão Preto and signed informed consent forms. They underwent MRI scanning on a 3T device and high resolution 3D T1 images were used for volumetric analyses. For every subject, we used the pipeline CERES to compute grey matter volumes of the different cerebellar lobules. Between-group comparisons were carried out using the non-parametric test Mann-Whitney. FDR-corrected p-values <0.05 were considered significant. Results: Both sporadic and C9orf72-related ALS had cerebellar damage compared to controls. However, their patterns of grey matter atrophy were distinct. Sporadic ALS patients had smaller volumes at left lobules I-II and right lobule VI compared to controls (p=0.019 and 0.046, respectively). In contrast, C9orf72-related ALS group presented only left sided lobule X atrophy in comparison to controls (p=0.037). Direct comparison of sporadic vs C9orf72-ALS revealed smaller volumes for left lobules I-II in the former group (p=0.046). Conclusion: This exploratory study reveals not only that the cerebellum is affected in ALS, but also that the pattern of damage is distinct in sporadic and C9orf72-related ALS. It remains to be investigated what the clinical correlates of such damage are, especially cognitive and/or behavioural manifestations.",Doenças do Neurônio Motor  Esclerose Lateral Amiotrófica,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,PAULA NOCITO REBELLO,Paula Nocito Rebello / Rebello PN / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS - UNICAMP; Thiago Junqueira R. de Rezende / de Rezende TJR / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS - UNICAMP; Lucas de Melo Teixeira Branco / Branco LMT / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS - UNICAMP; Marcondes Cavalcante França Junior / França MC Jr / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS - UNICAMP; Antonio Carlos dos Santos / dos Santos AC / UNIVERSIDADE DE SÃO PAULO - RIBEIRÃO PRETO - USP-RP; Wilson Marques Jr / Marques W Jr / UNIVERSIDADE DE SÃO PAULO - RIBEIRÃO PRETO - USP-RP;
73414,LARYNGEAL ELECTROMYOGRAPHY IN PATIENTS WITH AMIOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS): PRELIMINARY RESULTS,"INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is the most relevant motor neuron disease in adults and characterized by widespread weakness. Despite frequent bulbar involvement, little is known about clinical and electrophysiological changes in the larynx in patients with ALS. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and pattern of involvement of laryngeal muscles in ALS and its functional relevance. In addition, we assessed whether laryngeal EMG (LEMG) would increase the diagnostic sensitivity for ALS. METHODS: Twenty five ALS patients, 24 with spinal onset and 1 with bulbar onset, underwent nasofibroscopy (NF) followed by LEMG, in which a concentric needle was used to evaluate the thyroid-arytenoid (TA), lateral crico-arytenoid (CAL), posterior crico-arytenoid (CAP) and crico-thyroid (CT) muscles, at rest and during activation. After LEMG, resting and activation of the genioglossus and masseter muscles were also studied using the same concentric needle. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 54,2 years and there were 11 women. The procedures were fast (30 minutes on average) and uneventful. Twenty three patients presented neurogenic changes in at least one laryngeal muscle. Only two patients had entirely normal LEMG. We found a pattern compatible with chronic denervation (MUAPs remodeling and incomplete recruitment) with the following frequency: TA muscle in 18/25 patients (72%); CT in 16/25 patients (64%); CAP in 13/25 patients (52%) and CAL in 13/25 patients (52%). In 14 patients, there were fibrillations and / or fasciculations associated with chronic neurogenic changes in the same muscle; of these, 7 had no alteration in the genioglossus muscle and 2 had only chronic alterations in the same muscle. We found no patients with tongue neurogenic changes and normal LEMG. NF revealed motor abnormalities in the larynx in 15 patients; in the remaining 10, NF was normal but LEMG identified signs of denervation in 9 of them. CONCLUSIONS: LEMG is able to identify laryngeal denervation in patients with ALS. This procedure may increase diagnostic sensitivity for ALS by identifying bulbar involvement in patients without tongue denervation. Changes in LEMG may precede clinical involvement of the larynx in these patients.",Doenças do Neurônio Motor  Esclerose Lateral Amiotrófica,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,MELINA PAZIAN MARTINS,"MELINA PAZIAN MARTINS / Martins, M.

73760,"CLINICAL, GENETIC AND NEURORRADIOLOGICAL PROFILE OF PATIENTS WITH PURE AND COMPLICATED PEDIATRIC-ONSET HEREDITARY SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA","Introduction: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a rare group of inherited disorders with overall prevalence of 1 to 10 per 100,000 and is characterized by progressive degeneration of the corticospinal tracts. The HSPs are differentiated into pure forms if the only clinical finding is bladder dysfunction and spastic paraparesis, and complicated if there are additional neurologic or systemic abnormalities. Objective: To study the clinical, genetic and neuroradiological profile of pure and complicated SPG with symptom onset in the pediatric age group (0-18 years old). Methods: Evaluation of clinical, neuroimaging and genetic findings within a group of 22 patients with symptoms beginning between 0 and 18 years old. Results: Forms: 10 patients presented with pure forms and 12 patients with complicated forms. 8 had a negative family history for neuromuscular or neuropsychiatric disorders; Age of onset: between 0-17 years. 2 before the first year of life (SPG4, SPG3A), 4 infants (<2 years), 8 preschoolers and schoolchildren (3-11 years), 8 adolescents (12 -18 years); Average age: 8.6 years; Gender: 10 male, 12 female; Genetic profile: 11 patients had a defined genetic diagnosis of SPG4, 2 with SPG3A, 3 of SPG11, 1 of SPG7, 1 of HSP associated with the RNASEH2B gene and 4 patients have still undetermined forms after complete exome sequencing (two with pure forms and one with ataxia and axonal neuropathy). 2 where identified with new variants in the SPAST gene. Complicating factors: optic atrophy (n=5), autistic spectrum and language disorder (n=4), cerebellar ataxia (n=4), sensorineural deafness (n=3), polyneuropathy (n=3), motor neuronopathy (n=2), systemic autoimmune context (RNASEH2B) (n=1). Neuroimaging: thinning of the corpus callosum (n=4; 3 SPG11, 1 SPG3A), the ""Ears of the Lynx sign (n=3), mild hyperintense corticospinal tract (n=16); subtle signal abnormalities of white matter (n=2; SPG11, RNASEH2B). Electroneuromyography: marked chronic axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy (n=3; 2 SPG3A, 1 SPG11), chronic pure motor neuronopathy (2 SPG11) Conclusion: Although spastic paraparesis and urinary dysfunction represent the most common clinical presentation, a complex group of neurological and systemic compromise has been recognized recently and a growing number of new genetic subtypes were described in the last decade.

73049,COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY IN SKELETAL MUSCLE FROM PATIENTS WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a hereditary, degenerative and progressive skeletal muscle disease. It is caused by the absence of the protein dystrophin and is characterized by progressive loss of muscle strength and deterioration of functional capacity. Abnormalities in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, proteolysis and energy metabolism, especially mitochondrial dysfunction, are part of the pathogenesis of the disease. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a potent antioxidant that participates in respiratory chain activity, has been used in clinical trials, however, there are no studies showing its involvement in DMD. The purpose of this study was to investigate CoQ10 in skeletal muscle from patients with DMD in relation to the proportion of muscle fiber loss in the biopsies and the activities of the respiratory chain enzymes. We studied 22 muscle biopsies from patients with DMD and ten muscle biopsies from controls. The concentration of CoQ10 was measured using the reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography technique. Activities of the respiratory chain enzymes were measured by spectrophotometry. The mean age of patients with DMD was 6.9 years (SD± 2.4; range 1.9 to 11.8 years) and of controls was 8 years (SD± 2.69; range 4 to 12 years). The mean CoQ10 content in fragments from patients with DMD was 8.6 μg / g tissue (SD± 3.9) and in fragments from controls was 31.6 μg / g tissue (SD± 6.9), indicating a significant decrease of CoQ10 in muscle biopsies of patients with DMD (p<0.001). The mean area occupied by muscle fibers in patients with DMD was 27.3% (SD± 14.2%) and in controls was 89.2% (SD± 3.3%). There was a high correlation between the amount of CoQ10 and the relative area occupied by muscle fibers (r= 0.767 and p= 0.016). The activities of respiratory chain enzymes from patients with DMD were not deficient. On the other hand, the results of the combined analysis of complexes II + III, for which the presence of CoQ10 is essential, were significantly reduced in patients with DMD. The response of the activity of complexes II + III to the addition of CoQ10 to the enzymatic assay (recovery rate) was significantly higher in samples from patients with DMD than in samples from controls. In the present study, we demonstrate that there is a significant deficiency of CoQ10 in muscle from patients with DMD. This knowledge contributes for our understanding of DMD physiopathology and is relevant for therapy.",Doenças Neuromusculares,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,LARISSA DE OLIVEIRA OKAMA,"LARISSA DE OLIVEIRA OKAMA / Okama, L.

72972,EXPANDING THE PHENOTYPE OF DMD WOMEN CARRIERS: CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IS AFFECTED,"Introduction: Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) are X-linked genetic disorders caused by mutations in the DMD gene that target skeletal muscles, heart and central nervous system (CNS). The majority of female carriers of a single allele mutation are considered asymptomatic, but this concept has been challenged recently. Some women indeed present muscular and cardiac symptoms, but no formal evaluation of CNS involvement was carried so far. Objectives: To evaluate the structural and functional CNS status in carrier women. Methods: Fourteen women with a DMD mutation had cognitive function assessed using Addenbrooke - Revised (ACE - R) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Cognitive Examination. They underwent investigation of structural abnormalities of cerebral gray and white matter using T1-weighted and diffusion tensor images obtained on a 3T MR scanner. An age-matched group of healthy women was used as control for MRI comparisons. Analyses were accomplished using the FreeSurfer software and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Significance was established at p < 0.05. Results: The mean age of recruited women was 37.3 years old (SD = 6.4) and mean education was 8.5 years (SD = 3.6). Mean ACE-R and MOCA scores were 73.7±9.6 and 24.5±2.1, respectively. Seven patients (50%) scored below the expected Brazilian and schooling-adjusted reference levels. The subdomains that exhibited the greatest impairments were attention/orientation, language and visuospatial abilities. Quantitative analysis of the T1w images showed right inferior temporal cortical thinning in carrier women compared to controls. We did not find white matter abnormalities among carriers. Conclusions: Women carrying DMD mutations have cognitive deficits and cerebral structural abnormalities. Temporal regions look particularly vulnerable, but further studies are necessary to characterize the full pattern of brain damage in these patients and their clinical significance.",Doenças Neuromusculares,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,STEPHANY DA SILVA PASSOS,"Stephany da Silva Passos / Passos, S.S / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS; Pilar Sílvia Oliveira Tavares / Tavares, P.S.O. / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS (UNICAMP); Letícia Silva Souza / Souza, L.S. / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS (UNICAMP); Thiago Junqueira R. de Rezende / Rezende, T.J.R. / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS (UNICAMP); Anamarli Nucci / Nucci, A. / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS (UNICAMP); Marcondes Cavalcante França Júnior / França Júnior, M.C. / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS (UNICAMP);"
74678,PROPOSING OF A LESS COSTLY STRATEGY FOR MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS OF CONGENITAL MYASTHENIC SYNDROME IN BRAZIL.,"Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome (CMS) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders in which the safety margin of neuromuscular junction is impaired due to genetic defects. So far, more than 30 different genes have been associated to this entity, what makes the molecular diagnosis sometimes difficult to be done without resorting to new generation sequencing (NGS). Such technology, although its cost has dropped considerably, is not yet widely available, especially in developing countries. Nevertheless, some specific pathogenic variants are notably common in particular regions, and one CHRNE variant was shown to be highly prevalent in Brazil. Objective: 1) to verify if variants that are common in other regions account for a significantly proportion of CMS causative genes in Brazilian population, 2) to propose a cost-effective strategy to make molecular diagnosis of CMS in this population. Methods: 60 patients of 51 Brazilian unrelated families with clinical diagnosis of CMS were included. All patients were submitted to Sanger sequencing of appropriate coding regions where the following common variants are located: c.130dupG on CHRNE; c.1327delG on CHRNE; c.1124_1127dupTGCC on DOK7; and c.264C>A (better known as p.N88K) on RAPSN. After this first step, patients were submitted to whole exome sequencing. Results: from 51 index cases, 17 harbored the CHRNE c.130dupG, with 14 in homozygosis; 3 harbored the RAPSN c.264C>A, 2 in homozygosis; 2 harbored the DOK7 c.1124_1127dupTGCC, 1 in homozygosis; none harbored the CHRNE c.1327delG. The first screening was able to find a pathogenic variant in 43% of the patients. Beside the common variants, other pathogenic variants were detected in the following genes: CHRNE (n=4); DOK7 (n=1); CHAT (n=1) COLQ (n=1); CHRNA1 (n=1); COL13A1 (n=2); SCN4A (n=3). In the end, 5 patients were diagnosed as not CMS: 4 patients were disclosed as complex genetic syndromes and one as myofibrilar myopathy. Eleven index cases remained undiagnosed. Conclusion: the variants c.130dupG (CHRNE), c.1124_1127dupTGCC (DOK7) and c.264C>A (RAPSN) are significantly present among CMS Brazilian cohort. Performing low-cost technique as RFLP-PCR to testing these variants in patients with compatible clinical presentation can be worthwhile, as up to 43% of cases are possible to be genetically solved. Even when NGS is available, this screening could be done before NGS, in order to perform a cost-effective diagnostic strategy.",Doenças Neuromusculares,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,EDUARDO DE PAULA ESTEPHAN,"Eduardo de Paula Estephan / Estephan, EP / Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP); Vitor Marques Caldas / Caldas, VM / Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP); Antonio Alberto Zambon / Zambon, AA / Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP); Paulo Eurípedes Marchiori / Marchiori, PE / Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP); André Macedo Serafim da Silva / Silva, AMS / Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP); Rodrigo Holanda Mendonça / Mendonça, RH / Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP); Ana Töpf / Töpf, A / Institute of Genetic Medicine - Newcastle University; Umbertina Conti Reed / Reed, UC / Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP); Hanns Lochmüller / Lochmüller, H / Department of Neuropediatrics and Muscle Disorders - University of Freiburg; Edmar Zanoteli / Zanoteli, E / Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP);"

Gene expression in the hippocampus has not been evaluated regarding language impairment in MTS. Objective: To identify hippocampal CA3 transcriptional modules related to language and memory impairment in mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) patients. Design/Methods: Forty-one patients with unilateral left MTS and 20 healthy controls, aged 18-55 years, IQ>70, without comorbidities, underwent a language and memory battery, including, verbal and non-verbal memory, semantic and phonetical fluency, object, proper noun and responsive naming tests. We established cut-offs scores using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis, comparing patients and controls performances to yield best sensitivity and specificity. We classified patients as normal or impaired, and generated cognitive impairment scores. RNA was extracted from fifteen histopathologically confirmed hippocampal CA3 specimens obtained during amygdalohippocampectomy. We used 44k DNA microarrays to obtain transcriptome profiles, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Networks Analysis (WGCNA) package for complex network analysis, based on Gene Ontology annotated genes. Cognitive performance was correlated with transcriptional network modules, controlling for confounders (antiepileptic drug load, topiramate use, febrile seizure history and lesion side). Results: Groups did not differ in age, gender and education. Patients showed decreased scores in a number of cognitive tests, compared to controls. Impaired object naming was associated with altered gene expression in synaptogenesis, worse overall language performance with differential gene expression in neuron excitability, worst overall performance in verbal memory tests with differential expression of genes related to neuronal excitability and glutamate metabolism, moderate non-verbal memory impairment (four out of five altered tests) exhibited altered expression patterns of genes involved in glutamate metabolism and neuronal apoptosis signaling. Conclusions: We found an association between CA3 transcriptional signatures and clinical patterns of language and memory impairment. A better understanding of cellular mechanisms associated with language impairment may contribute to elucidate the role of the hippocampus in language and semantic memory in MTS patients.",Epilepsia,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,JOÃO GABRIEL MANSANO DE OLIVEIRA,"João Gabriel Mansano de Oliveira / Mansano-Oliveira, JG / FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA USP; Silvia Yumi Bando / Bando, S / FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA USP; Fernanda Bertonha / Bertonha, F / FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA USP; Christiane Messas / Messas, C / FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA USP; Betina Castro / Castro, B / FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA USP; Carlos Moreira / Moreira, C / FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA USP; Luiz Henrique Martins Castro / Castro, LH / FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA USP;"
74012,BDNF SERUM LEVELS RELATED TO PHARMACO-RESISTANCE IN TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY,"Introduction: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a pro-epileptogenic neurotrophin widely distributed in central nervous system. The BDNF is mainly concentrated in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, areas involved in temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE -HS) epileptogenesis. Methods: We included 148 TLE-HS patients (ILAE criteria and signs of HS in MRI) aged between 22 and 68 years-old. Patients with suspicion of non-epileptic events were not included. All patients were under antiepileptic drug treatment. The individuals had MRI and blood samples collection at the same day. Blood serum levels of BDNF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were divided into two groups according to pharmacoresistance: I. FREQ: (n=91): patients with at least 3 seizures with impaired awareness or one bilateral tonic-clonic seizure in 6 months ; II. INFREQ: (n=57) patients with less than 2 seizures with impaired awareness in 6 months. Furthermore, we evaluated if patient presented seizures in the last month before the blood collection. Results: The groups were similar according gender and age. The group with frequent seizures (FREQ) presented higher BDNF serum levels than the infrequent seizures group (INFREQ)(p=0.003). There was no difference in BDNF serum levels between patients with or without seizures in the last month before blood collection. Discussion: In vitro analysis have already suggested that seizures can be related with higher levels of BDNF in hippocampus. However, our study demonstrated that blood serum BDNF is not related to recent seizures, but probably with the pathogenic process of repeated seizures and pharmacoresistance.",Epilepsia,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,MARINA KOUTSODONTIS MACHADO ALVIM,"Marina Koutsodontis Machado Alvim / Alvim MKM / UNICAMP; Marina Koutsodontis Machado Alvim / Alvim MKM / UNICAMP; Clarissa Lin Yasuda / Yasuda CL / UNICAMP; Marcia Elisabete Morita / Morita ME / UNICAMP; Ana Carolina Coan / Coan AC / UNICAMP; Renata Barbosa / Barbosa R, / UNICAMP; Luciana Ramalho / Ramalho L / UNICAMP; Natalia P Rocha / Rocha NP / UFMG; Érica Leandro Marciano Vieira / Vieira ELM / UFMG; Iscia Lopes-Cendes / Lopes-Cendes I / UNICAMP;"
74785,EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUAL PATTERNS OF FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL NEURAL NETWORKS IN PATIENTS WITH FOCAL PHARMACORESISTANT EPILEPSY,"Introduction: Epilepsies are conditions of functionally and anatomically connected networks, which may explain ictal and interictal phenomena. Aim: To investigate the distribution and overlap of individual functional and structural networks in patients with focal pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Methods: We analyzed 25 patients (18-56 years, 52% male) with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies followed at a tertiary epilepsy center and submitted to concomitant EEG and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI). All had the epileptogenic zone (EZ) defined according to extensive pre-surgical evaluation. Patients underwent EEG-fMRI in a 3T MRI, with acquisition of eco-planar and T1-weighted images. EEG was acquired using 64 MRI-compatible electrodes. Individual interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were visually identified in the EEG and used to define blood oxygen level depended (BOLD) changes (p<0.001, minimum of 20 contiguous voxels) The evaluation of the individual structural brain changes looking for gray matter (GM) atrophy was performed with voxel based morphometry analysis. T1-weighted volumetric images of 150 healthy subjects (19-69 years, 41% male) were used as control and compared to the image of each patient (two-sample t-tests, p<0.001, minimum of 20 contiguous voxels). We evaluated the co-localization of structural and functional abnormalities through the co-registration of maps of each patient. Results: The evaluation of individual structural abnormalities demonstrated GM atrophy ipsilateral to the EZ in frontal (64% of patients), temporal (56%) and parietal lobe (44%) and contralateral to the EZ in frontal lobe (44%). Regarding functional abnormalities, IED-related BOLD was observed ipsilateral to the EZ in frontal (88%), temporal (72%) and parietal lobe (68%) and contralateral to the EZ in frontal lobe (64%). The co-registration of individual maps showed that 40% (10/25) of patients had overlap of the functional and structural abnormalities; however, in average, only 1.07% of the individual areas of the structural abnormalities had an overlap with the functional abnormalities). Conclusion: The present work showed no significant overlap of the GM atrophy and the interictal-related functional changes in patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies.

73618,"IMPORTANCE OF DENGUE, ZIKA AND CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS RESEARCH IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID AS CAUSE OF ACUTE NEUROLOGIC MANIFESTATION IN ENDEMIC AREAS","Introduction: Increased of cases reports of neurological manifestations associated with dengue (DENV), zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) have been described in endemic areas. Neurological symptoms are not specific, making diagnosis difficult, which is based on the detection of viral antigens and specific antibodies primarily in serum, in addition to other fluids. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis by the proximity of the central nervous system (CNS) and meninges can demonstrate inflammatory reaction, protein cytologic dissociation, exclusion of other infectious diseases, and the detection of the etiological agent. Objective: To detect the presence of arboviral infection in the CSF of patients with acute neurological manifestations, using immunology and molecular biology techniques. Methods: A panel of CSF samples from 36 suspected cases of acute CNS viral infection or post-infectious syndromes were analyzed. We evaluated specific IgM antibodies for DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV. To investigate viral RNA we performed the Semi-Nested RT-PCR for DENV and real-time RT-PCR for ZIKV and CHIKV. Results: Of the total group, 28% (10/36) fulfilled the arbovirus positivity criteria (specific reactive IgM or presence of viral RNA) in the CSF. Of these 10 cases, 40% (4/10) were diagnosed with DENV and 60% (6/10) with CHIKV. Encephalitis was the most frequent neurological manifestation with 60% (6/10) of the cases, three of them resulting from DENV infection and three cases due to CHIKV infection. The virological study presented amplification for viral RNA DENV of 50% (5/10) the cases and in 50% (5/10) for viral RNA CHIKV in the CSF. No sample amplified for ZIKV. In the immunological analysis, 20% of the samples (1/5) showed reactive CSF IgM against DENV and 80% (4/5) reactive IgM against CHIKV. In the routine CSF analysis, we observed pleocytosis with a predominance of mononuclear and hyperproteinorrhachia in 70% of the samples, and hypoglycorrhachia in 27.3%, following the inflammatory profile of the CSF expected in viral infections. Conclusion: The detection of viral antigens and antibodies in CSF are of great importance for the elucidation of neuropathogenesis and support the diagnosis of tropical neurological diseases of the CNS caused by arboviruses.

Whether decreased SICI is related to severity of symptoms or to subtle structural brain changes in this condition had not yet been determined. Purposes: To test the hypotheses that there is a significant difference in SICI between controls and patients according to RLS severity. To compare TMS parameters of resting or active motor threshold, cortical silent period and SICI between RLS patients and controls. To perform FreeSurfer analysis and test the hypotheses that there are significant differences in gray matter thickness or volume in the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex, caudate, pallidum, putamen, and thalami between patients with RLS and controls. Methods: TMS testing (single and paired-pulse) was performed on the dominant motor cortex and data compared by ANOVA one-way. A post-hoc ROC curve analysis was performed to define a relevant cut-off (area under the curve>0.70) value of SICI to discriminate RLS and control group, morphometric analysis of cortical surface was performed by Freesurfer and analyzed in a whole-brain approach and by also regions of interest. Results: TMS data of 34 RLS patients and 24 controls were analyzed. SICI was reduced in severe and very severe RLS group in comparison to healthy individuals and in light to moderate RLS group in comparison to controls (F=8.83; p=0.001). The resting motor threshold, active motor threshold and cortical silent period were not different between patients with RLS and controls. A cut-off of 31.5% of SICI using ROC curve analysis could discriminate RLS and controls group. Morphometric analysis by Freesurfer was performed in 35 RLS patients and 26 controls. No structural differences were found in analyses of the whole brain or of regions of interest. Conclusions: The results support the presence of a dysfunction in GABAA receptors activity, but not in GABAB, in the motor cortex even in less symptomatic forms of RLS. Cortical surface and subcortical volume analysis by Freesurfer did not show differences between patients with RLS and controls. Together, these results suggest that restless legs syndrome is a dysfunctional non-degenerative disease and that SICI is a cortical biomarker for this condition.",Neurofisiologia Clínica,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,ADRIANA BASTOS CONFORTO,"SAMIR CÂMARA MAGALHÃES / Magalhães, S.C. / HOSPITAL ISRAELITA ALBERT EINSTEIN; Joselisa Péres Queiroz de Paiva / de Paiva, J.P.Q. / HOSPITAL ISRAELITA ALBERT EINSTEIN; Alan Luiz Eckeli / Eckeli, A.L. / HOSPITAL DAS CLÍNICAS DA FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA UNIVERISDADE DE SÃO PAULO - RIBEIRÃO PRETO; Gilmar Fernandes do Prado / do Prado, G.F. / UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SÃO PAULO; Edson Amaro Jr. / Amaro, E.Jr. / UNIVERSIDADE DE SÃO PAULO E HOSPITAL ISRAELITA ALBERT EINSTEIN; Adriana Bastos Conforto / Conforto, A.B. / UNIVERSIDADE DE SÃO PAULO E HOSPITAL ISRAELITA ALBERT EINSTEIN;"
73348,A NOVEL COMPLEX NEUROLOGICAL PHENOTYPE DUE TO A HOMOZYGOUS MUTATION IN FDX2,"Introduction: Defects in [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis are increasingly recognized as causing neurologic disease. Mutations in a number of genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial [Fe-S] protein assembly lead to complex neurological phenotypes. One class of proteins essential in the early cluster assembly are ferredoxins. FDX2 is ubiquitously expressed and is essential in the de novo formation of [2Fe-2S] clusters in humans. We describe and genetically define a novel complex neurological syndrome identified in two Brazilian families, with a novel homozygous mutation in FDX2. Material and Methods: Patients were clinically evaluated, underwent MRI imaging, nerve conduction studies, electromyography and muscle biopsy. The genetic analysis were done using a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing was performed. The functional studies were done by Real Time RT-PCR and Western Blot (WB) analysis, iron stain in muscle and electronic microscopy. Results: We identified six patients from two apparently unrelated families with autosomal recessive inheritance of a complex neurological phenotype involving optic atrophy and nystagmus developing by age 3, followed by myopathy and recurrent episodes of cramps, myalgia and muscle weakness in the first or second decade of life. Sensory-motor axonal neuropathy lead to progressive distal weakness. MRI imaging disclosed a reversible or partially reversible or partially reversible leukoencephalopathy. Muscle biopsy demonstrated an unusual pattern of regional SDH and COX deficiency with iron accumulation. The phenotype was mapped in both families to the same homozygous missense mutation in FDX2 (c.431C>T, p.P144L). The deleterious effect of the mutation was validated by Real Time RT-PCR and Western Blot (WB) analysis, which demonstrated normal expression of FDX2 mRNA but severely reduced expression of FDX2 protein in muscle tissue. Conclusion: This study describes a novel complex neurological phenotype with unusual MRI and muscle biopsy features, conclusively mapped to a mutation in FDX2, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial ferredoxin essential for early Iron-Sulfur cluster biogenesis. It was possible to describe the natural history of this new condition.",Neurogenética,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,ANDERSON RODRIGUES BRANDÃO DE PAIVA,"Juliana Gurgel-Giannetti / Gurgel-Giannetti, J / Department of Paediatrics, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Fernando Kok / Kok, F. / Neurogenetics Outpatient Service, Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; David S Lynch / Lynch, DS / Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK / Leonard Wolfson Experimental Neurology Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK; ANDERSON RODRIGUES BRANDAO DE PAIVA / Paiva, ARB / Neurogenetics Outpatient Service, Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Leandro Tavares Lucato / Lucato, LT / Radiology Institute, Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Guilherme Yamamoto / Yamamoto, G / Center for Studies of Human Genome and Stem Cells, Biosciences Institute, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Roland Lill / Lill, R / Institut für Zytobiologie und Zytopathologie, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Robert-Koch-Strasse 6, 35032 Marburg, Germany; Mariz Vainzof / Vainzof, M / Center for Studies of Human Genome and Stem Cells, Biosciences Institute, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Anders Oldfors / Oldfors, A / Department of Pathology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Henry Houlden / Houlden, H / Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK / Leonard Wolfson Experimental Neurology Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK;"
73585,CEREBELLAR INVOLVEMENT IN HEREDITARY SPASTIC PARAPLEGIAS,"Introduction: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized clinically by slowly progressive lower limb weakness and spasticity. Corticospinal tract is the key target of damage in the disease, but other structures are also involved. Little is known about cerebellar involvement in HSP. Objective: to identify cerebellar abnormalities in the most frequent subtypes of pure (HSP-SPG4) and complicated HSP (HSP-SPG11). Methods: We recruited 14 patients with HSP-SPG4 (8 men; mean age 48.9 ± 12.3 years), 14 with HSP-SPG11 (7 men; mean age 27.5 ± 5.1 years) and 26 healthy age and gender-matched controls (14 men; mean age 38.5 ± 14.8 years). Image acquisition was performed in a 3T MRI scanner and T1-weighted structural 3D images were assessed by the Spatially Unbiased Atlas Template (SUIT)-SPM12-toolbox. GM cerebellar volumes were compared between groups via voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Statistical analyses were performed in SPM12 using analysis of variance and FWE-corrected p-values<0.05. Results: Mean disease duration for patients with HSP-SPG4 and HSP-SPG11 were 19 ± 11.2 and 12.2 ± 6.9, respectively. Four patients with HSP-SPG11 had clinically evident ataxia. We failed to identify cerebellar GM atrophy in the HSP-SPG4 group. In contrast, patients with HSP-SPG11 had cerebellar volumetric reduction at both lobules VI and right sided crus I in comparison to healthy-controls. Conclusion: Cerebellum is affected in HSP-SPG11, but not HSP-SPG4. Lobules VI look particularly vulnerable. Such difference helps to understand the phenotypic differences between both diseases.",Neurogenética,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,KATIANE RAISA SERVELHERE,"KATIANE RAISA SERVELHERE / Servelhere, K.

74759,IDENTIFYING CIRCULATING BIOMARKERS IN PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC CAROTID ARTERY STENOSIS: A PRELIMINARY REPORT,"Stroke can occur due to an embolic blood clot formed during the rupture of an atherosclerotic (1). Atherosclerosis begins with the subendothelial accumulation of lipoproteins, followed by in-site migration of monocytes and lymphocytes type T, leading to a chronic inflammation clinically observed as stenosis, the thickening of the artery walls (2). Common risk factors for stroke are diabetes, obesity, arterial hypertension and smoking (2). Circulating microRNAs, found in plasma microvesicles, are non-coding RNA molecules which are involved in fine gene regulation and have been proposed as disease biomarkers for several conditions (3,4). Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to investigate whether there are differences in the circulating microRNAs of patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis as compared to controls with no stenosis. When completed, the study will be composed by a cohort of 120 patients: 30 controls with mild asymptomatic stenosis (<50%), 30 with moderate asymptomatic stenosis (50-70%), 30 with severe asymptomatic stenosis (70-99%) and 30 with severe symptomatic stenosis (70-99%). Peripheral blood has been collected from all patients for subsequent microRNA extraction using the mirVanaTM ParisTM Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). MicroRNAs have been converted into a cDNA library using the Illumina® TruSeq® Small RNA Library Prep RS-200-0048 Kit (Illumina, Inc). MicroRNA expression will be studied using the next generation sequencing platform HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, Inc). Sequencing data will be analyzed using bioinformatics protocols in which the sequencing reads will be aligned to a reference genome using the miRdeep software, normalized and counted with HTSeqcount and Feature counts; and the differential expression analysis will be performed with DEseq2 software. In this preliminary report, we characterize the cohort assessed to date. We have included 72 patients (mean age 67,9±10,7), 21 of them with severe asymptomatic stenosis and 15 with severe symptomatic stenosis. Risk factors identified are arterial hypertension (80%), diabetes (42%) and smoking (62%). Here we present preliminary results of our study which is likely to aid in the identification of non-invasive biomarkers related to the formation, growth, and rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque.

73534,STRUCTURAL SIGNATURE OF SCA3: FROM PRESYMPTOMATIC TO LATE DISEASE STAGES,"Introduction: Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is the most frequent spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and characterized by brainstem, basal ganglia and cerebellar damage. However, little is known about the natural history of the disease. Objective: To determine the extension and progression of central nervous system involvement in SCA3/MJD using multimodal MRI-based analyses in a large cohort of patients (n=79) and presymptomatic subjects (n=12). Methods: All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging in a 3T device to assess gray (GM) and white matter (WM). We used measures from FreeSurfer and SUIT to evaluate, respectively, the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. T1-multiatlas assessed deep GM. We used the DTI-multiatlas approach to investigate cerebral WM and SpineSeg to assess the cervical spinal cord. Results: In the general analysis (all patients vs all matched-controls), we found a widespread WM and cerebellar damage, in contrast to the restricted cerebral cortex involvement (mostly in motor cortex). The presymtomatic patients showed WM micro-structural abnormalities mainly in the cerebellar and cerebral peduncles and volumetric reduction of midbrain, spinal cord and substantia nigra. We divided the patients into 4 subgroups defined by the time from ataxia onset to assess the disease progression. We were able to found a clear pattern of evolving structural compromise, starting in infratentorial structures and progressing up to the cerebral cortex. Conclusion: Structural damage in SCA3/MJD begins in the spinal cord, cerebellar peduncles as well as substantia nigra, and progresses to cerebral areas in the long term. These structural differences reveal some insights into the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD and suggest a staging scheme to map the natural history of the disease.",Neurogenética,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,THIAGO JUNQUEIRA RIBEIRO DE REZENDE,"THIAGO JUNQUEIRA RIBEIRO DE REZENDE / Rezende, T.

74106,LOWER FREQUENCY OF ANTIBODIES TO MOG IN PATIENTS FROM RIO DE JANEIRO WITH NEUROMYELITIS SPECTRUM DISORDERS: AN ETHNIC INFLUENCE?,Objective: Antibodies against Myelin Oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-Ab) have been investigated as potential biological marker for neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and high-risk syndromes (HR) negative for AQP4-Ab in populations with different ethnic background. We tested AQP4 and MOG antibodies in a Brazilian population with high African ethnic background. Method The study population was composed of adult patients from Rio de Janeiro with neuromyelitis optica and high risk syndromes NMO-HR (new and old cases). Blood samples were sent blindly to test the AQP4 and MOG antibodies by CBA. The frequency of positive MOG-Ab was estimated in the NMO-HR and the NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD). A systematic review with meta-analysis assessed the frequency of MOG-Ab in Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Results 115 adult patients with NMO-HR were tested. MOG antibodies were found in 5/68 negative cases of AQP4-Ab negative (7.35%). The criteria for NMOSD were fulfilled by 70 patients with NMO-HR and none of them was positive for MOG-Ab. A low prevalence of MOG antibodies and a predominant phenotype of bilateral Optic Neuritis were found in most non-Caucasian patients. Conclusion The low frequency of MOG Ab in patients from Rio de Janeiro and in other non-Caucasian populations suggests a racial/ancestral influence.,Neuroimunologia,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,REGINA MARIA PAPAIS ALVARENGA,"REGINA MARIA PAPAIS ALVARENGA / Alvarenga, R.

74632,NEUROLOGICAL AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CLINICAL ASPECTS OF PATIENTS WITH LEPROSY IN FORTALEZA: STUDY OF 400 CASES.,"INTRODUCTION: Leprosy is caused by the infection of Mycobacterium leprae (ML). It is associated with damage to the peripheral nerves, skin and other tissues. The main signs and symptoms are: sensory and/or motor deficits and/or nerve enlargement. The Ridley-Jopling Classification applies the spectral concept of leprosy and divides the disease into two polar groups: Tuberculoid (TT) and Lepromatous (LL), and three intermediate types: Borderline-Tuberculoid (BT), Borderline-Borderline (BB), and Borderline-Lepromatous (BL). OBJECTIVES: 1-To identify clinical findings of neurological dysfunction in leprosy patients; 2-Correlate those findings with the clinical forms of leprosy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 400 leprosy patients, from a tertiary leprosy reference center from Fortaleza-Ce, from 2011 to 2014, evaluated by a predetermined protocol, consisting in history, dermato-neurological examination and routine laboratory tests. Histopathological examination was done in 243 patients. For diagnosis, the association of two elements (skin lesions, sensory changes and neural thickening), or only positive bacilloscopy in the skin or nerve was considered. Data collection (clinical and laboratory tests) was obtained from the medical records. RESULTS: 219 patients were male and 181 female. The mean age was 41.7 years. According to the clinical forms of leprosy (and the histopathological results of 243 patients) patients were classified as: TT:52; BT:121; BB:12; BL:16 and LL:41. Of this total, 32 cases were diagnosed as primary neural leprosy, 19 being TT and 13 BT (for inclusion in the treatment protocol as paucibacillary or multibacillary). Sensory changes were found in 91.7%, motor deficits in 59% and neural thickening in 50.2% of the patients. The most affected nerves were the motor and sensory ulnar fibers (57.4%); superficial peroneal (44.5%) and tibial posterior (30.7%). CONCLUSION: Sensory changes were more frequent than motor deficits. Hypoesthesia is the most prevalent symptom, especially in cases with an evolution of more than 12 months. The same relationship was not observed for motor deficits and neural thickening. The ulnar nerve was the most affected, followed by the superficial peroneal. Future research should focus on a comprehensive analysis of autonomic symptoms and small fiber neuropathy for early diagnosis and disability prevention.",Neuroinfecção,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,MOACIR PEREIRA LEITE MOACIR LEITE,"MOACIR PEREIRA LEITE MOACIR LEITE / Leite Neto, M.

Objective: To analyze and compare amyloid-β deposition, brain metabolism and neuropsychological profile of healthy controls (HC) and elderly with SCD. Methods: The sample consisted of elderly, with four or more years of schooling. Dementia, mild cognitive impairment, major psychiatric disorder or use of psychotropic drugs were the exclusion criteria. Subjects were divided into HC and SCD groups. The volunteers were evaluated with the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), Functional Activities Questionnaire, Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Brief Cognitive Screening Battery, a standard neuropsychological battery and the Short-term Memory Binding (STMB). SCD evaluation was based on the Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI). The Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were applied for the screening of anxiety and depression symptoms. Images of 18F-FDG and 11C-PIB were acquired from PET / magnetic resonance imaging equipment and analyzed individually with Z-score maps using the Cortex-ID software. For the comparison between the groups the images were corrected for partial volume and normalized for analysis by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 8). Results: Twenty-four elderly individuals (19 females) were included, with 15 in the SCD group. For the whole sample, mean age and schooling were 71.71 ( 5.83) and 12.70 ( 4.46) years, respectively, with no significant differences between the groups. The CFI score was higher in the SCD group (SCD 5.26 4.30 vs HC 1.22 1.48, p < 0.001). The SCD group had more anxiety symptoms (p = 0.018). No differences were found between groups in the MMSE (SCD 29.20 0.86 vs HC 29.44 0.72, p = 0.558) and MoCA (SCD 23.47 2.44 vs HC 25.11 2.89, p = 0.150). There were also no significant differences in specific cognitive tests. Only the STMB differentiated SCD (11.026 1.98) from HC (13.11 1.62; p =0.028). When compared with HC, SCD exhibited no significant differences between amyloid-β deposition. Discrete bilateral reduction of metabolism in lateral temporal regions in subjects with DCS, but no statistically significant. Conclusion: The STMB was the most sensitive to differentiate SCD from HC in this sample.

75184,"CORRELATION BETWEEN CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND FDG-PET PATTERN IN 111 PATIENTS WITH MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, SUBJECTIVE COGNITIVE DECLINE AND CONTROLS: ANALYSIS FROM THE BRAZILIAN AGING AND MEMORY STUDY (BRAMS)","Introduction: Recently more attention has been given to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD). It seems that those with multi domain amnestic MCI (maMCI) are at greater risk for development of Alzheimers disease. Besides, the categorization of MCI patients according to the NIA-AA ATN research framework will help recruit individuals with amyloid pathology for Disease Modifier Drugs trials. Objective: To determine a relationship between clinical diagnosis (control, SCD or MCI) and PET-FDG pattern; delineate the rate of possible etiology change when contrasting results from individuals submitted to PET-FDG and 11CPIB-PET (amyloid ligand). Methods: Patients who underwent FDG-PET (n=111) and 11CPIB-PET (n=21) were analyzed according to age, gender, schooling and clinical profile. FDG-PET was classified as normal, AD pattern (temporoparietal and/or precuneus and/or posterior cingulum hypometabolism) and non-AD pattern. 11CPIB-PET was classified as positive or negative. Results: Sixty six per cent were females; mean age was 69,9 years (69 for normal FDG-PET, 72 for AD pattern FDG-PET and 70 for non-AD pattern); mean schooling was 10,88 (+-5,1) years and did not differ according to FDG-PET profile. Controls had more education than maMCI: 13 (+-2,0) years versus 9,7 (+-5,1) years. Normal FDG-PET (n=68), AD pattern FDG-PET(n=21) and non-AD pattern (n=22) groups had maMCI as most frequent clinical diagnosis (52,9%, 57,1% and 45,5% respectively); the majority of maMCI (n=58) had normal FDG-PET (62%); individuals with SCD (n=14) were the ones with greater rate of normal FDG-PET (78,6%); among those who underwent FDG-PET and 11CPIB-PET (n=21) the rate of disagreement was 19% (n=4), of which 3 had FDG-PET compatible with AD pattern and 11CPIB-PET negative (1 maMCI; 1 single domain amnestic MCI; 1 single domain non-amnestic MCI) and 1 had normal FDG-PET with 11CPIB-PET positive (single domain non-amnestic MCI). Conclusions: Among individuals with multi domain amnestic MCI most had normal FDG-PET. However, among those with FDG-PET compatible with AD the majority was composed by multi domain amnestic MCI patients (57,1%). The disagreement rate between FDG-PET and 11CPIB-PET was 19%, lower than the rate shown by the ABIDE Project (25%). Disagreement occured mainly due to AD pattern FDG-PET when compared with 11CPIB-PET negativity.

73126,CORTICOBASAL SYNDROME: CLINICAL FEATURES AND METABOLIC IMAGING PATTERN.,"Introduction: Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS) was first considered a motor disorder with parkinsonism, dystonic and myoclonic movements. It is now also recognized as a cognitive disorder associated with several cortical features. CBS denotes the phenotype of multiple pathologies, including Corticobasal Degeneration and Alzheimers disease (AD). New diagnostic methods are being developed to predict the underlying pathology. Objectives:To investigate the prevalence of symptoms through the cognitive and movement disorders profile and compare the clinical features according to the different brain functional patterns measured with FDG-PET and SPECT, exploring the potential role of these techniques as diagnostic biomarkers. Methods: Sixteen patients with diagnosis of probable CBS were submitted to FDG-PET (14 patients) or SPECT (2 patients). They were first clinically diagnosed with CBS and investigated in relation to their movement disorders profile and cognitive symptoms. According to the FDG-PET or SPECT patterns, they were distributed into an AD group (CBS likely related to AD) and a non-AD group (CBS likely unrelated to AD). Results: mean age at presentation and schooling were 65,63 (+-8,23) and 4,63 (+- 2,99) years. Fourteen patients were submitted to FDG-PET and two realized SPECT. Twelve had a non-AD pattern and four had an AD-pattern. There were significant differences on Mini Mental Score Examination(MMSE) (AD = 5,25 +- 7,54 vs non-AD = 15,02 +- 7,24 p = 0,035) and Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scale (AD = 1,75 +- 0,86 vs non-AD = 3,54 +- 1,45 p = 0,015). Parkinsonism was present in 100%, myoclonus and dystonia in 56,3%. Apraxia was the most prevalent cognitive feature (87,5%). Aphasia and cortical sensory loss were noted in 50% and 43,8%. Only one patient had alien limb. Dystonia demonstrated a significant difference between groups as 100% presented a non-AD pattern (p=0,019). Apraxia of speech also showed a tendency to correlate to the non-AD group, as 100% had a non-AD pattern(p=0,181). Conclusion: Dystonia and apraxia of speech were most closely related to a non-AD and myoclonus to an AD functional pattern of CBS. Patients with an AD pattern had lower ACE-R and MMSE and higher HY scale scores. Functional nuclear imaging shows a potential to predict the different CBS variants while depicting their specific patterns.Two individuals with AD pattern tested positive for amyloid scan, which is associated as an evidence of AD pathology.",Neurologia Cognitiva E Do Envelhecimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,JACY BEZERRA PARMERA,"JACY BEZERRA PARMERA / Parmera, J.

75264,DIFFERENCES IN DEFAULT MODE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY IN MCI WITH AND WITHOUT AMYLOIDOSIS: A PRELIMINARY STUDY,"Introduction: The neural network with more biological alterations in Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is the Default Mode Network (DMN). The structures in DMN are vulnerable to the deposition of amyloid (Aβ). Research on functional connectivity (FC) in early dementia is recent, and there is still a need for more studies on the correlation between pathologic alterations and the disease natural history. One of the first stages in AD natural history is Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).There´s probably a difference in DMN connectivity between MCI patients with and without AD pathophysiology. Objective: To compare DMN FC in MCI subjects with AD pathophysiology (MCI- AD+, i.e., altered Aβ) versus non-AD MCI (normal Aβ levels). Methods: We recruited 70 volunteers (50 MCI and 20 controls). All subjects underwent MRI in a 3T scanner and all MCI subjects underwent lumbar puncture to evaluate Aβ42 levels. We considered as altered Aβ42: < 540 pg/mL. 11 of the MCIs were classified as non-AD MCI (normal Aβ) and 39 were MCI-AD+ (altered Aβ). Controls were used to define normal DMN mask. To identify the DMN, we placed a seed in the posterior cingulate cortex. The analyses of FC were performed by using UF2C software. Results: A paired-samples t-test was conducted to evaluate FC differences in MCI patients regarding Aβ42 status. We found that MCI-AD+ had increased FC in left hippocampus (t= 2.77, adjusted p= 0.032) in comparison with non-AD MCI. Analyses of all other regions disclosed no significant results. Conclusion: We found an increased hippocampal FC in MCI subjects in the AD spectrum (altered Aβ) in comparison with non-AD MCI. This finding may indicate that hippocampus may increase its connectivity as a compensatory mechanism only in the subjects in AD spectrum, represented by MCI-AD+ subjects. Non-AD MCI might have FC alterations in other brain networks rather than DMN. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings.",Neurologia Cognitiva E Do Envelhecimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,BERNARDO LEITE PONDÉ DA LUZ,BERNARDO LEITE PONDÉ DA LUZ / Bernardo Leite Pondé da Luz / UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS (UNICAMP); Thamires N.

72758,NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS RELATED TO NEUROPATHOLOGIC VS. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF DEMENTIA,"BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy and disinhibition are associated with the clinical syndromes of both dementia of the Alzheimer-type (DAT) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Clinical studies suggest apathy alone or in combination with disinhibition is the most common initial symptom in bvFTD and more prevalent than in DAT. The differential frequencies of these features alone or in combination in AD vs. FTLD (Alzheimer´s disease neuropathology vs. frontotemporal lobar degeneration) have not been determined. OBJECTIVE: Amnestic dementias of the Alzheimer-type (DAT) and behavioral dementias of the frontal-type (bvFTD) can be associated with the neuropathology of either AD or FTLD. The primary aim of the present study was to compare the frequency of apathy and disinhibition in DAT and bvFTD caused by either AD or FTLD. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from 1304 cases with autopsy-confirmed disease in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) database. The frequencies of apathy, disinhibition, or the combination of both were compared in 4 groups DAT/AD (n=1055), DAT/FTLD (n=51), bvFTD/AD (n=57), bvFTD/FTLD (n=141). Chi-square analyses were used. RESULTS: In AD neuropathology, the most common symptom was apathy without disinhibition (33%; p<0.001). FTLD neuropathology was more frequently associated with the combination of apathy and disinhibition (44%; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy, disinhibition or the combination of the two have differential associations with AD and FTLD neuropathology. In this sample of 1304 patients, AD pathology was more frequently associated with apathy alone, whether the clinical syndrome was DAT or bvFTD. In contrast, FTLD pathology was more frequently associated with the combination of both neuropsychiatric symptoms in its clinical manifestations of either DAT or bvFTD.",Neurologia Cognitiva E Do Envelhecimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,LETIZIA GONÇALVES BORGES,"LETIZIA GONÇALVES BORGES / Borges, L.

73128,OROFACIAL MYOFUNCTIONAL DISORDER IN INFANTS WITH ZIKA-ASSOCIATED MICROCEPHALY,"Introduction: Children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) may have a high risk of orofacial myofunctional disorders (OMD), especially after the fourth month of life, when they are transitioning from reflex to voluntary swallowing. However, the clinical complications of OMD have not been studied in these children. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of OMD in children with CZS and determine the predictors of enteral nutrition or respiratory tract infection (RTI). Methods: Hospital-based cohort of babies born during the Zikavirus outbreak. We identified CZS by head circumference at birth less than 2 standard deviations below Intergrowth standard, excluding other TORCH infections by serological assays. Two independent speech therapists evaluated anatomical structures for OMD before and during feeding. Children were followed for three main clinical outcomes: use of antibiotics or hospital admission for RTI; and indication for enteral nutrition. We constructed Kaplan Meier curves for each outcome of RTI or enteral nutrition and selected variables associated with each outcome by a log-rank p-value < 0.2. Backward selection using multivariable Cox regression was then performed including each of these variables for the combined outcome of RTI or enteral nutrition. Results: 77 children, mean age 8.6 (+/-5.4) months were evaluated. We detected OMD in the following anatomical structures: tongue in 57 (74%), lips in 43 (56%), buccinators in 44 (57%). Concordance rates for each anatomical structure for both speech therapists were excellent (kappa=0,67 to 1.0, p<0.001). Dysphagia was detected in 32 (42%) children: 28 (36%) for liquid consistency, 1 (1%) for solid and 3 (3.9%) for both consistencies. After a mean 16.5 (+/-7.4) months of follow-up, 9 (11.7%) required enteral nutrition, 25 (32.5%) required antibiotics for RTI and 22 (28.6%) were admitted due to RTI. Combined outcome occurred in 27 (35%) children. In multivariable analysis, predictors of the combined outcome were: head circumference percentile at birth (OR=0.82 per Z-score increase; 95% CI=0.70-0.97, p=0.016) and type of dysphagia (global vs absent OR=5.18; 95% CI=1.01-26.62, p=0.049). Conclusions: Children with CZS frequently present with OMD. Those with more severe microcephaly or with early dysphagia for more than one type of consistency are at high risk for RTI or enteral nutrition.",Neurologia Infantil,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,JOSEANE SANTOS SEIXAS ROSA BOUZON,"JOSEANE SANTOS SEIXAS ROSA BOUZON / Bouzon, J.

75246,CLINICAL AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROFILE OF ANTI-FGFR3-RELATED NEUROPATHY.,"Background: Sensory neuronopathies (SN) are disabling disorders characterized by multifocal sensory deficits, areflexia and proprioceptive ataxia. First report of SN date to 1948 and etiological diagnosis remain elusive for a significant proportion of patients. Antifibroblast growth factor receptor 3 antibodies (Anti-FGFR3) were recently described in SN patients, but it is not yet clear its impact in the clinical setting. Objective: To access the diagnostic value and the clinical/neurophysiological phenotype of Brazilian patients with anti-FGFR3+ neuropathy. Methods: We tested consecutively 42 patients with non-paraneoplastic SN followed in a tertiary neuromuscular clinic. All patients fulfilled Camdessanchés criteria for SN, were older than 18 years and signed an informed consent form. We collected data on the clinical phenotype, LANSS and SCOPA-AUT questionnaires and nerve conduction findings/autonomic evaluation of anti-FGFR3+ patients. These results were then compared with those of anti-FGFR3- patients. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used for comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: 16/42 patients (38%) were anti-FGFR3+. This group included 12 women with a mean age at disease onset of 43.6±6.2 years. The most common heralding symptoms were ataxia (46.6%) and numbness (40%). Sensory deficits were asymmetric in 14/16 patients, 9/16 were labeled as idiopathic SN and 7/16 had concomitant dysimmune conditions. Clinical course followed a chronic progression in 11/16 patients. Pain was present in 13/16, with neuropathic characteristics in 11/16. Mean SCOPA-AUT score was 29.5±13.4, 15/16 had at least one abnormal site in Qsweat exam and 14/16 fulfilled criteria for cardiac autonomic neuropathy. NCS findings in anti-FGFR3+ were asymmetric, non-length dependent and exclusively sensory in 12/16, 10/16 and 12/16 patients, respectively. Comparison between anti-FGFR3 + and - patients revealed no significant difference of clinical/demographical profile (p>0.05). However, anti-FGFR3+ group had greater sensory/motor disproportionate involvement as revealed by USMAR values (0.15±0.27vs.0.49±0.5,p=0.02). Conclusions: Anti-FGFR3 antibodies underlie a significant proportion of Brazilian SN patients. The average anti-FGFR3+ patient is a middle-aged woman with chronic sensory ataxia and remarkably disproportionate sensory involvement in NCS. This antibody should be included in the routine diagnostic work up of non-paraneoplastic SN.",Neuropatias Periféricas,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,ALBERTO ROLIM MURO MARTINEZ,"ALBERTO ROLIM MURO MARTINEZ / Martinez, A.

74959,EPSTEINBARR VIRUS INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY IN NORTHEAST BRAZIL,"Background. Little is known about the epidemiology and the prognostic factors of GuillainBarre syndrome (GBS) following primary infection with EpsteinBarr virus infection (EBV) in Brazil. Methods. We prospectively followed 111 patients with GBS cases who were admitted to our center from 2012 through 2017. EBV specific IgM antibodies were determined. Clinical and electrophysiologic features of the cases were considered the ones positive versus negative for EBV (groups). Results: Of the 111 GBS cases studied, 11 (10%) had detectable EBV-specific IgM antibodies. The mean age of EBV-positive GBS was younger (34,2 years), but there was no difference between groups (p=0,7388). The mean time to reach nadir was 8.2 days in the EBV-positive GBS and 7.8 days in the EBV-negative GBS (p=0,7585). Sensory loss was more common in the EBV positive GBS (90.0%) and occurred only in 48.6% EBV-negative GBS (p=0,0232). Facial palsy was more frequent in the EBV-positive GBS (90.9% X 47%; p=0,0084). There was no difference in the need for mechanical ventilation between the EBV-positive GBS and EBV-negative GBS groups, respectively, 27.7% and 18% (p=0,4327). There was also no difference in the mean days to the recovery of independent locomotion between EBV-positive GBS and EBV-negative GBS groups, respectively, 33.2 and 36.8 days (p=0.5013). In the EBV-negative BS, 10% had anti-GM1 IgG antibodies, whereas none in EBV-positive-GBS had them. One patients of the EBV-negative GBS group died. Nerve conduction study indicated that 72.7% of patients who were in the EBV-positive-GBS had the primary demyelinating form of the disease, and 9% had the primary axonal form. Conclusions: We demonstrate that EBV was common cause of antecedent infection in GBS (10%) and have different clinical pattern in comparison with the other GBS group. They develop significantly cranial nerve involvement and severe sensory loss, and were often associated with the demyelinating variety of GBS.",Neuropatias Periféricas,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,MARIO EMILIO TEIXERIA DOURADO JR,"MARIO EMILIO TEIXERIA DOURADO JR / Dourado, M.

73968,"PRIMARY NEURAL LEPROSY: CLINICAL, SEROLOGICAL, MOLECULAR, AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS.","Introduction: Leprosy neuropathy is considered the most common peripheral neuropathy of infectious etiology worldwide, representing a public health problem. Clinical diagnosis of primary neural leprosy (PNL) is challenging, since no skin lesions are found and the slit skin smear bacilloscopy is negative. Objectives: Characterize the clinical, molecular, serological and neurophysiological aspects in patients with PNL. Methodology: 70 individuals with diagnosis of PNL were recruited among 317 new cases from July 2014 to July 2016 treated in a national reference center of leprosy in Brazil. All the individuals were submitted to a clinical, serological, molecular and electroneuromyographic evaluation. Results: The average age was 42.9 (±17.3) years, and 52.9% (37/70) were male. 61.4% (43/70) were clearly symptomatic. All symptomatic patients (61.4%; 43/70) presented an asymmetric neural impairment, with a predominance of sensory symptoms, particularly hypoesthesia, paresthesia and pain, evidenced by thermal, painful and tactile impairment, in addition to an intradermic sensory involvement in 69.8% (30/43). Deep reflexes and vibration sensation changes were present in 8.6% (6/70), while 30% (21/70) complained of muscular weakness and/or amyotrophy. Neural thickening was observed in 58.6% (41/70), of which 75.6% (31/41) presented focal myelin impairments in the electroneuromyographic evaluation. Electroneuromyography showed a pattern of mononeuropathy in 51.4% (36/70) and an average of 2.3 altered nerves per patient. The most frequently affected nerve was the ulnar in the elbow segment (34.4%). Positivity for ELISA anti-PGL1 was 52.9% (37/70), while the qPCR of slit skin smear was 78.6% (55/70). The qPCR of nerve biopsies was positive in 60.8% (17/28). Patients with multiple mononeuropathy patterns showed lower levels of anti-PGL-1 (p=0.0006), and higher frequency of neural thickening (p=0.0008) and sensory symptoms (p=0.01) than those with mononeuropathy. The positivity of qPCR in slit skin smears was smaller in this group (p=0.03). Conclusion: Immunological, molecular, and neurophysiological tools must be implemented for diagnosing primary neural leprosy to achieve effective treatment and reduction of its resultant disabilities that still represent a public health problem in several developing nations. We propose an algorithm and recommendations for the diagnosis of primary neural leprosy based on the combination of the three clinical-laboratorial tools.",Neuropatias Periféricas,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,DIOGO FERNANDES DOS SANTOS,"DIOGO FERNANDES DOS SANTOS / Santos, D.

71691,NEUROPROTECTIVE AND REPAIRING PROPERTIES OF THE PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITOR PENTOXIFYLLINE IN THE RAT CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AFTER INJURY,"Pentoxyfilline (PTX) is a methylated xanthine and a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that depresses the activation of glial cells, whose responses induce oxidative stress and neural tissue damage during inflammation. Ethidium bromide (EB) injection into the brain causes local oligodendroglial and astrocytic loss, resulting in primary demyelination, neuroinflammation and peripheral astrogliosis by surviving astrocytes around the injury site, with increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). This investigation aimed to evaluate the capacity of PTX of affecting glial cell behaviour during the process of demyelination-remyelination and of altering cytokine release and lipid peroxidation (measured through its byproducts TBARS or thiobarbituric acid reactive species) in the plasma and and brain. Male Wistar rats were injected with 0.1% EB or 0.9% saline solution into the cisterna pontis and treated or not with PTX (25 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal route) during the experimental period. Brainstem samples were collected on days 7, 15, 21 and 31 following the intracisternal injection and were processed for light and transmission electron microscopy as well as for GFAP immunohistochemistry. Astrocytic reactivity was assessed by morphometry and a semi-quantitative method was used for documenting in semithin sections the extent and nature of remyelination following the gliotoxic lesion. Plasma and brains were also collected for TBARS and cytokines (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6, measured by ELISA). Results showed that PTX treatment decreased serum and brain levels of TBARS, and cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha (but not IL-6) in the brain of EB-injected rats until day 15. PTX also reduced GFAP expression until day 21 and increased oligodendroglial remyelination examined on day 31. Schwann cell remyelination was noted in EB-injected rats treated or not with PTX. These data suggest that PTX stimulates remyelination, decreases both inflammation and redox imbalances and may have a preventive role in glial scar development following gliotoxic injury.",Neurorreabilitação,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,EDUARDO FERNANDES BONDAN,"Eduardo Fernandes Bondan / Bondan, E.F. / Universidade Paulista; Carolina Vieira Cardoso / Cardoso, C.V. / Universidade Paulista; Maria de Fátima Monteiro Martins / Martins, M.F.M. / Universidade Cruzeiro do Sul;"

They are characterized by the presence of progressive cerebellar ataxia, whose initial clinical manifestations are deterioration of balance, coordination, and eye disorders. Objective: To verify the effect of a balance rehabilitation program using virtual reality (VR) in patients suffering from SCAs. Method: A prospective observational study was carried out with 28 patients with SCAs, eight females and 20 males, between 15 and 70 years of age (mean age of 41.5 years, standard deviation of 16.9 years). Patients were submitted to anamnesis, otorhinolaryngological and vestibular screening, Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and SF-36 questionnaire, applied before and after rehabilitation with VR. Result: a) The most reported otoneurological complaints during anamnesis were: imbalance (85.7%), fall (28.5%), dizziness (17.8%), diplopia (10.7%) and tremor (7.1%); b) Final scoring of questionnaires DHI and BBS was better after rehabilitation; c) SF-36 questionnaire showed significant change in the following aspects: functional capacity for the Soccer Heading, Table Tilt e Tightrope games (P <0,05), pain and mental health for the Ski Slalom game (P <0,05); d) There was significant patients improvement in the post-rehabilitation assessment with VR in all games used (Soccer Heading, Tightrope, Table Tilt e Ski Slalom) (P <0.05). Conclusion: We can point out the importance of rehabilitation with VR in sufferers from SCAs due to the fostered benefits.

72848,INFLUENCE OF RISK OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA ON CEREBRAL VASOREACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH STROKE,"Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is present in 60-70% of stroke patients. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease in OSA are not well elucidated. Cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with stroke and OSA has not been studied and could identify a new pathophysiological mechanism with potential therapeutic intervention. Therefore, we aimed to investigate cerebrovascular reactivity in stroke patients with different risk categories for OSA. Methods: Cross-sectional study of a cohort of patients with stroke, using clinical questionnaires (SOS score and STOP-BANG score) to assess the risk of OSA and transcranial Doppler (TCD) to assess cerebral vasoreactivity (breath holding index-BHI- and visual evoked potential). Results: 84 patients were included, 73% with medium or high risk for OSA (STOP-BANG 3.48 ± 1.57, SOS score 15.46 ± 7.40); 57 performed TCD. Mean BHI was 0.48 +/- 0.37; visual evoked potential 0.10 +/- 0.05, with 41 (74%) showing low vasorreactivity (BHI < 0.69). Vasorreactivity did not correlate with risk of OSA (p>0.1). Systemic hypertension was the main risk factor associated with both impaired vasorreactivity and OSA risk. Conclusion: There is a high risk of OSA and impaired vasorreactivity in the population that suffered a stroke, but OSA does not seem to directly impact cerebral vasorreactivity.",Neurossonologia,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,PEDRO JOSÉ RAMIRO MUIÑOS,"Renan Carvalho Castello Branco / Castello Branco, R.

73570,WHITE-MATTER PATHWAYS IN PRIMARY RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME/ WILLIS-EKBOM DISEASE ASSESSED BY PROBABILISTIC TRACTOGRAPHY,"Introduction: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS/WED), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a potentially disabling sensorimotor disorder characterized by an urge to move the limbs (mostly the legs), associated with unpleasant sensations that usually begin or worsen during rest and are alleviated by movement. More recently, subtle abnormalities in the white matter micro-organization, detected by Diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI), have attracted attention in RLS/WED. Tractography estimates the representation of white matter fiber bundles and allows extraction of quantitative parameters from isolated tracts. Objective: To analyze DTI metrics extracted from pathways likely involved in RLS/WED pathomecanisms. Age and gender-matched controls were recruited among hospital workers and acquaintances of the researchers. History and physical examination, including neurological examination, were performed in both RLS/WED and control subjects. Diffusion MRI scans were acquired on a Siemens 3,0T Tim Trio, with 30 non-collinear directions. Probabilistic tractography of the corticospinal tract, was performed in 38 RLS/WED subjects and 24 controls with FSL-PROBTRACKx. DTI metrics (FA, AD, MD and RD) were extracted from the following tracts-of-interest: corticospinal tract, thalamic radiations (superior and posterior), corpus callosum (forceps minor and major), medial lemniscus and cerebellar peduncle. Results: In the RLS/WED group, both MD and RD were decreased in the forceps major, however, none of these differences survived after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: We encourage replicability of our findings with more sophisticated acquisitions and application of non-tensor-based models, such as HARDI, for better precision in estimating metrics in regions of crossing-fibers.",Sono,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,ADRIANA BASTOS CONFORTO,"Joselisa Péres Queiroz de Paiva / de Paiva, J.P.Q. / Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein; Samir Câmara Magalhães / Magalhães, S.C. / HOSPITAL ISRAELITA ALBERT EINSTEIN; Luciana Monteiro de Moura / Moura, L.M. / UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO ABC (UFABC); Gilmar Fernandes do Prado / Prado, G.F. / UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SÃO PAULO (UNIFESP); Alan Luiz Eckeli / Eckeli, A.L. / HOSPITAL DAS CLÍNICAS DA FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA UNIVERISDADE DE SÃO PAULO - RIBEIRÃO PRETO; João Ricardo Sato / Sato, J.R. / UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO ABC (UFABC); Edson Amaro Jr. / Junior, E.A. / HOSPITAL ISRAELITA ALBERT EINSTEIN; Adriana Bastos Conforto / Conforto, A.B. / HOSPITAL DAS CLÍNICAS DA FACULDADE DE MEDICINA DA UNIVERISDADE DE SÃO PAULO - RIBEIRÃO PRETO;"
74453,CLINICAL AND GENETIC EVALUATION OF SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA TYPE 10 IN 19 BRAZILIAN FAMILIES,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by a noncoding ATTCT pentanucleotide expansion1,2. SCA10 patients have a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, with dysarthria, dysphagia and epilepsy1. The frequency of epilepsy in patients with SCA10 differs between different studies  3.5% in southern Brazilian families versus approximately 60% in Mexican patients3,4. Previous studies have also shown disparities regarding age at onset of symptoms and expansion size5,6. The aims of this study were to characterize the phenotypic expression of SCA10 and to examine its genotype-phenotype relationships. One hundred and two Brazilian patients with SCA10 from 19 families were prospectively assessed; severity of ataxia was assessed by a standardized protocol and the SARA scale, and expansion size was determined by Southern blot. The mean (±SD) age of onset of symptoms was 35 (±10) years, the mean duration of symptoms was 10 (±8) years, and the mean number of repeats was 1886 (±417). Clinical presentation included gait ataxia (100%), dysarthria (92.1%), horizontal nystagmus (84.3%), cerebellar atrophy on neuroimaging (80.4%), limb ataxia (79.4%) and dysmetria (37.2%). Three out of the 102 (2.94 %) patients presented with epilepsy. The relationships between age of onset and expansion size (Spearman‘s rho [rs] = -0.33941; p = 0.02102), and between duration of symptoms and ataxia severity (rs = 0.32793; p = 0.00098) were found to be statistically significant. A weak significant correlation was observed between age of onset of symptoms and expansion size, and between SARA score and duration of symptoms. In this series of Brazilian patients with SCA10, the prevalence of epilepsy was low and the main clinical presentation was pure cerebellar ataxia, associated with cerebellar atrophy on neuroimaging.",Transtornos do Movimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,ALEX TIBURTINO MEIRA,"Bernardo MD Domingues / Domingues, BMD / UFPR; Alex T Meira / Meira, AT / UFPR; Bernardo MD Domingues / Domingues, BMD / ; Fábio A Nascimento / Nascimento, FA / ; Adriana Moro / Moro, A / ; Salmo Raskin / Raskin, S / ; Tetsuo Ashizawa / Ashizaw, T / ; Hélio AG Teive / Teive, HAG / ;"
74628,ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC STUDY OF SEIZURES INDUCED BY THIOCOLCHICOSIDE,"Introduction: Thiocolchicoside (TCC) is a semi-synthetic derivative analogous to colchicine. It is extensively used for the clinical treatment of muscle pain, being classified as central-acting myorelaxant. Colchicine can experimentally induce seizures in animals (mice, rabbits and rats). When administered intraventricular (CNS), it is followed by a generalized seizure and death of the animal. At high doses, TCC may also potentiate seizures in animals and humans, particularly in patients who already have a history of epilepsy, but this effect is not described in the drug package. Objective: to describe electroencephalographic alterations of the convulsive potential of TCC in rats. Methods: Eighteen male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control (n = 9) and treated with 12 mg/kg of the said drug (n = 9). The animals underwent a surgical process to implant electrodes in the stereotaxic reference of bregma-0.96 in the primary motor cortex region. Three days after surgery, the animals were connected to an amplifier with the data acquisition system. These were analyzed in MATLAB routine. Results: Electroencephalographic (EEG) tracing demonstrating regularity in the baseline state with spectrogram showing potentials in frequencies below 10 Hz. Alterations in the EEG tracing showing increased amplitude and frequency of spikes after TCC use, the spectrogram demonstrates greater energy distribution in the frequencies up to 50 Hz. In the power spectral distribution graph, it is shown a statistical difference in the oscillations up to 50 Hz. In the graph of accumulated frequency up to 50 Hz, in the basal state the accumulated amplitude had a mean of 0.6613 ± 0.09866 mV2 / Hz X 10-3 with statistical difference for the TCC group that presented a mean of 11.91 ± 2.333 mV2 / Hz X10-3.

73488,EVALUATION OF BRAIN CONNECTIVITY IN DYSTONIA USING QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY,"Introduction: Dystonia is a neurological syndrome characterized by sustained and involuntary muscle contractions, repetitive movements and twists that lead to disability and have no cure. The basal ganglia have been implicated in dystonia pathophysiology, but the role of other brain regions is still unclear. Possibly, these patients have sensorimotor integration abnormalities. The study of brain connectivity is necessary to provide new insights to develop efficient therapeutic approaches, such as neuromodulation. Objective: The aim of this work is to investigate brain connectivity features in patients with idiopathic dystonia using multivariate EEG data. Methods: in this study, we recorded EEG from 21 subjects (10 patients with right upper limb idiopathic dystonia and 11 controls) during the writing task. Two patients were excluded due to EEG noise that could not be filtered. We applied power spectra analysis considering the mu (12 to 15 Hz) and beta (15 to 30 Hz) rhythms of the motor cortex, evaluating the energy of each rhythm and the beta-mu ratio. Results: preliminary results show a statistically significant difference in the energy expressed by beta rhythm (p = 0.0391) and by the beta-mu ratio (p = 0.0078) between the right and left hemispheres of patients. However, due to the sample size, we could not find significant differences in power spectra between patients and controls. Conclusion: When we consider the median energy of beta rhythm and beta-mu ratio in both hemispheres of patients, we observed that the median energy in both measures is higher in the right hemisphere when compared to the left hemisphere. This result may indicate a dysfunction of reciprocal inhibition mechanisms in dystonia, but further analysis will be necessary to investigate this hypothesis. Power spectra analysis provides important information to investigate the changes in brain connectivity in movement execution related rhythms. This study will be complemented with evaluations during different tasks, such as finger-tapping and resting state, and we will apply complex network analyzes on these data. To obtain a thorough panel of brain connectivity in dystonia, these results will be compared to data obtained from methods with different space-time resolutions, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and near infrared spectroscopy obtained from ongoing projects of our research team.",Transtornos do Movimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,CARLOS ARRUDA BALTAZAR,"CARLOS ARRUDA BALTAZAR / Baltazar, C.

74668,FEASIBILITY OF 3T MRI NIGROSSOMAL MORPHOLOGIC CHANGES TO DIFFERENTIATE PARKINSON DISEASE FROM ESSENTIAL TREMOR AND CONTROLS  PRELIMINARY DATA,"Introduction Parkinson‘s disease (PD) motor features are identiﬁed relatively late in the pathological process when approximately 50% of dopaminergic neurons have been lost in the substantia nigra (SN).The nigrosome-1 (N1) region of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) undergoes the greatest and earliest dopaminergic neuron loss in PD and this neurodegeneration was only possible to be visualized in postmortem neuropathological studies. Recently developed high-field MRI systems produce high resolution images providing detailed SN morphologic information and the possibility of detect in vivo changes in SN morphology, in special the N1. The diagnosis of PD continues to be challenging with misdiagnosis rates as high as 20-30% in early stages. Objectives Quantify nigral changes with focus on the presence of the N1 within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) as well investigated the feasibility of this morphologic changes at 3T MR imaging for the diagnosis of patients with PD and diferentiate it from essential tremor (ET) and volunteers without neurological disease. Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and participants gave informed consent. This study enrolled 39 patients with PD, 21 healthy volunteers with no signs of neurodegenerative disease and 8 with ET, from a single especialized service in São Paulo City in the period of march 2016 to april 2018. The clinical diagnosis of PD and ET were made according to the criteria for each disorder and the control patients had any type of neurological disorder excluded through anamnesis and clinical examination. MRI images were obtained with T2 3D Multi Echo sequence and evaluated by two blinded radiologists separately for the presence or absence of each N1. Results Of the 39 patients with clinical diagnosis of PD, 36 presented absence of at least one N1, 2 patients with inconclusive alterations and 1 patient with both N1. Six patients with ET presented normal nigrossomes and 2 absence of at least one of them. Nineteen control patients had normal nigrossomes and two patients had at least one altered N1. The sensitivity for nigrossomal changes in PD was 92.3% and the specificity was 86.2% with an accuracy of 93.8% in the ability to differentiate DP from ET and control patients. Conclusion The results suggest that MRI at 3T allows the detection of nigrosome-1 in health volunteers and ET patients and its absence in PD, yielding to high accuracy in diferentiatte those conditions.",Transtornos do Movimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,GABRIEL HENRIQUE ALMEIDA ANTONIO BIENES,"GABRIEL HENRIQUE ALMEIDA ANTONIO BIENES / Bienes, G. / UNIFESP; Caroline di Pietro Zorzenon / / UNIFESP; Henrique Ballalai Ferraz / / UNIFESP; Ernesto Duarte Alves / / UNIFESP;"
74537,MASTERING THE SUBSTANTIA NIGRA: MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY TO MRI SIGNAL LOSS PARKINSONS DISEASE,"Background: Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of neuromelanin of the substantia nigra (SN). Specific T1-weighted and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences have been shown to detect neuromelanin (NM) and nigrosome-1 signal changes, respectively, that discriminate PD patients from controls.1-3 It is unclear, however, if this decreased signal can be a biomarker of disease progression. Objective: The aim of this study is to delineate the anatomy of the SN and unveil its complex relationship between the anatomical structures within the subthalamic area and demonstrate the signal changes in the early disease stage. Methods: Fiber dissection were performed in 20 hemispheres in accordance with the Klingler method. All around fiber dissections from all aspects of the brain were performed in a stepwise manner to reveal the three-dimensional (3D) anatomy of the SN. After multidisciplinary clinical evaluation, T1-w images and SWI were performed in one PD patient and compared to the findings in the human cadaveric brain in a 11.1T MRI in axial and coronal cuts. Results: Our study correlated the results of SN fiber dissection with SWI (Figure 1) and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (Figures 1 and 2). A model of the SN has been built in order to clarify its anatomical relationships with the GPi laterally and superiorly, the posterior limb of the internal capsule anteriorly and laterally, the medial lemniscus posteriorly, the subthalamic nucleus superiorly, and the red nucleus medially. The clinical findings of mild tremor and no significant alteration in balance tests were minor when compared to the severe reduction of NM signal in the T1-weighted MRI and decrease of spontaneous hyperintensity in the posterior aspect of substantia nigra due to decreased nigrosome-1 content. Conclusions: This study revealed the complex 3D neuroanatomy of the SN and peri-subthalamic area. SN area evaluated by NM-sensitive and SWI MRI may be a promising biomarker of nigral degeneration, but not disease progression in PD patients, contradicting previous studies.3 Further studies may help to elucidate these findings.",Transtornos do Movimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,SARA CARVALHO BARBOSA CASAGRANDE,"Vanessa M.

72945,PLASMATIC AND CEREBROSPINAL FLUID ENDOCANNABINOIDS LEVELS IN PARKINSONS DISEASE,"Introduction: Parkinsons disease (PD) is a frequent neurodegenerative disorder, but there are no specific biomarkers for its diagnosis. Anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are the most important endocannabinoids which participate in many functions in nervous system, and their roles in PD are not clear. Objective: We aimed to analyze association of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) endocannabinoids levels 1) between PD and healthy controls (HC), and 2) between PD patients with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) and PD without LID. Also, we aimed to examine association of endocannabinoids levels with motor and non-motor features of PD. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional and observational study to explore plasma and CSF AEA and 2-AG associations with PD and LID. PD patients with levodopa therapy and HC were enrolled. PD patients and HC, and PD patients with and without LID were matched by sex and age. Presence of LID was confirmed if UPDRS Part IV had a score ≥ 1 on item 32. Plasma and CSF levels of AEA and 2-AG were analyzed using a fast, sensitive, and selective column switching ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method, with a restricted access media column in the first dimension and a core-shell Kinetex C18 in the second one. Results: 67 subjects were enrolled (HC  n = 20, median age 63 years, males 30%; DP with LID  n = 24, median age 59 years, males 62.5%; DP without LID  n = 23, median age 64 years, males 78.3%). After matching by sex and age, CSF 2-AG levels were higher in DP with LID than in DP without LID (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.03). Plasma and CSF 2-AG levels were lower in DP than in HC (Wilcoxon test: plasma 2-AG, p = 0.06; CSF 2-AG, p = 0.02), and CSF AEA levels were higher in PD than in HC (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.002). Also, lower levels of plasma AEA were associated with postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) motor phenotype (Spearmans correlation, ρ = 0.38, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Plasma and CSF AEA and 2-AG, mainly 2-AG, can be useful as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PD patients.",Transtornos do Movimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,BRUNO LOPES DOS SANTOS LOBATO,"BRUNO LOPES DOS SANTOS LOBATO / SANTOS-LOBATO, B.

72970,SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIAS  GENOTYPICAL AND PHENOTYPICAL EVALUATION OF 213 BRAZILIAN FAMILIES,"BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCAs) are neurodegenerative diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance and phenotypic-genotypic heterogeneity. The most common SCA is the Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3), followed by SCA2, SCA1 and SCA6. SCA10 is more commonly found in Mexico and South America, particularly in populations with Amerindian descent. OBJECTIVE: To describe and correlate the genotype and phenotype of patients diagnosed with SCAs. METHODS: Data were collected from the records of our ataxia outpatient clinic considering the genetic diagnosis of SCA in the index case of each family. The inclusion criteria were met by 460 patients from 213 families. These patients were divided into four groups: SCA3, SCA10, Other SCAs and Without Mutation. RESULTS: The most frequent subtype was SCA3 (n=210, 45.7%), followed by SCA10 (n=84, 18.3%) and Other SCAs (n=61, 13.3%). Patients without a confirmed mutation represented a total of 105 cases (22.8%). Statistically significant (p<0.05) differences were observed for several symptoms when comparing SCA3 and SCA10. We highlight the presence of bulging eyes in 57.6% of patients with SCA3 and 1.2% with SCA10 (p<0.001); horizontal ophthalmoplegia in 67.5% of patients with SCA3 and 9.5% with SCA10 (p<0.001) and vertical ophthalmoplegia in 23.5% of patients with SCA3 and 1.3% with SCA10 (p<0.001). The prevalence of epilepsy in SCA10 patients was 4.8%. There was an inverse correlation between the age of onset and the number of expansions of the mutated genes for SCA3 (p<0.001) and SCA10 (p=0.021), with higher expansions linked to earlier onset. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a high frequency of SCA10 when compared to data from other studies, which can be explained by a founder effect caused by the large number of Amerindian descendants in our region. In addition, we found several symptoms that may clinically differentiate SCA3 from SCA10, thus helping neurologists request the right confirmatory genetic test and define prognosis. Furthermore, the low prevalence of epilepsy in our SCA10 patients suggests a genetic variation of the disease, which is typically defined as an association between ataxia and epilepsy. This variation may be explained by a different pattern of interruptions in the mutated ATTCT genetic sequence and additional studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, the inverse correlation between number of expansions and age of onset represents the occurrence of an anticipation phenomenom.",Transtornos do Movimento,Aprovado para Apresentação Oral ,VINÍCIUS OLIVEIRA ROCHA RODRIGUES,"VINÍCIUS OLIVEIRA ROCHA RODRIGUES / Rodrigues, V.
